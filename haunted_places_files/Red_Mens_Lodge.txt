description: Many strange occurrences in unit to the right side of building. The feeling of a ghostly hand pushing from behind you. Spirit lights in the upstairs hallway at night. Bathroom door slamming shut on several occasions. Crackling sounds, at night, from the top of the stairs. A specter dressed in a strange costume with a feathered hat appeared from a small closet in the middle bedroom, danced across the room, bowed and then disappeared through another, closed, door.
