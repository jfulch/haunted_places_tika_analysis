description: Black Horse Inn - In 1927 a mobster was shot to death in the hall by the restrooms he got up to use the phone. He fell down the stairs to the basement; he hit his head on the wall. He died in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. Johnny is what people nowadays call him. He turns clocks back, hides things, is even known to touch you. A fire started in the attic quite a few years ago. They never found out how it started. It is also one of the oldest buildings around.
