description: During the early 1900s a young girl named Kate stayed at the castle, after it was turned into a bed and breakfast. When she heard the news that her fianc√© had been lost at sea the committed suicide and jumped from her third floor room, 306. It is said that singing can be heard from the bathroom at night. Also the heat goes through many changes as if she is changing the heat herself. There is a broken clock that chimes. A book was once left in the room so that guests could record their experiences, but was taken out because it scared guests so much they asked for a room change. But Kate is a friendly ghost and there is said to be a portrait of her hanging in the lounge and the back wall. Numerous apparitions have been seen in the castle. One Visitor took a picture in the room they where staying and there was clearly an image of a woman staring out the window towards the ocean. She was clothed in late 1800's attire with a bonnet. It is also rumored that a monk hung himself in the attic. Lights go on and off by themselves, doors open and close in the same fashion. Was featured on the television show "Sightings". True ghost hunters will agree it is well worth a night's stay to truly see evidence of the supernatural. Open to the public, reasonably priced. Good restaurant.
