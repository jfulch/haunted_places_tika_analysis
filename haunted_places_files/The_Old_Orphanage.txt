description: There is an old orphanage owned by a local family that sets right off a side street. Several of my friends were given a tour of the orphanage by it's past owners. They were told that many of the orphans that died were buried in the basement. Also, there were rooms located in the house that were used for shock treatment sessions. They took a self-guided tour through the house and reported that they saw sparks coming out of the room where the shock therapy took place. Also, they saw a baby doll in one room; the doll was also in the next room that they went to. They went back to the first room and found that the doll was missing from it. There were cold spots throughout the house.- November 2003 update - burned down summer of 2002.
