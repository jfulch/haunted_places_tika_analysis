city: Northport
country: United States
description: Just off Highway 43 outside Northport, the ghosts of two Confederate widows have been known to approach passing cars, thinking they were the wagon carrying their husbands back after the Civil War. Unfortunately, they are rarely seen nowadays because the road has been paved, the area has been developed, and it is not as rural anymore.
