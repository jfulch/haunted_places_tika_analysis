description: It is said that there was a man working on the upstairs railing above the dance floor when the restaurant was being built. He was adding something to the railing, when he fell to his death on the left side of the dance floor. His name is John Brown, he has his own table in the upstairs dining area. Table #218, it sits between the entrance to the kitchen and the grill window. The upstairs lights are on a timer, set to go off at exactly 1am, but John likes to keep the light above his table lit till way after that time. Also, managers and employees have quit there jobs there because around 4am, some nights, they have seen lights turn on and off, phones ring off the hook, printers spit out whole rolls of gibberish, doors swing by themselves, and also hearing footsteps on the dance floor. He is also known to haunt the men and women's restrooms upstairs, no matter what, the lights find a way to mysteriously turn themselves on in the restrooms. There has also been reports of cold spots felt in the women's restrooms.
