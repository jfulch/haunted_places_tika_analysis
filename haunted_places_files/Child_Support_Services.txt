description: In the place, is a woman around 20-30 walking around, moving things. People always mistake her for a woman working there. She's always walking around after closing time, and when the janitors are trying to clean, she's always getting in front of the vacuum. She doesn't bother people, but she REALLY scares them and always misplaces workers badges and keys.
