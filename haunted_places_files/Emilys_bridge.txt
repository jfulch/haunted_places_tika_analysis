description: In the 19th century a girl was going to elope with the man of her dreams. (Even though her parents disliked the man entirely) He told her to meet him at the covered bridge nearest to their homes the next day at noon. When she got there no one was there. she waited for hours and he never showed. She was so desperate for his love she committed suicide. Now if you go there at night and drive your car she will sometimes call out for "help" and scratch your vehicle or do something to it as you go through. Also you can see a whitish glowing figure walk up and down the bridge.Another version is: a woman died (probably by her own hands) and haunts "her" bridge.  She died in the 1800's and people (and cars and horses) have from time to time gotten scratches on them from unseen nails.  Also lights and noises can be heard.
