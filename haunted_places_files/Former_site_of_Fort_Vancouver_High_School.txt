description: When the school was built in the 1930's a maintenance man died while putting up a basketball hoop 40 feet in the air his ladder broke and he fell to his death...Some people say that late at night when you are in the gym you can hear the sound of a ladder falling and a loud crash along with a man falling from what looks like thin air and when he hits the ground you hear a loud crack...one of the past teachers that worked there said to a couple of the new teachers that they saw the same thing, plus when the went to look at the man they saw his bones poking out of his neck then he disappeared into thin air.
