description: There was a man that would take girls in the back of the park near the back of the baseball field and he raped and killed them. A man named Glen weaver was walking there one night and witnessed one of the girls being raped he got killed trying to save her. The park was renamed after him. The other guy was executed later that year. Girls that go into the park often feel uneasy when going toward the back of the park and later feel like someone is protecting them. At least 4 reports have been made about men that have had a history of hurting women have things like being cut and burned for no apparent reason while at the park. And two accounts of men being possessed and acting violent while at the park and not remembering it later after leaving.
