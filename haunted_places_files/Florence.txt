The columns of the old ruins are still standing. The hauntings occur in the slave cemetery and the family cemetery as well. There have been many people that have claimed to see the ghost of a tall, stately woman in the family cemetery. The cemetery is surrounded by a ten foot high wall. If you kiss the symbol on the top of the tallest burial marker, the lady is said to appear. In the slave cemetery, low African Spiritual singing and sounds of mourning can be heard at around midnight in the cemetery.
