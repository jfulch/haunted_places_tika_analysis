description: This two story stage stop was built in 1861. A woman in a white wedding dress haunts the front porch of the ruined stone building. She is the ghost of Kathleen Cooper, who still waits for her husband-to-be. The gold miner she waits for was killed in a holdup on his way to the wedding. She most commonly appears to people on horseback but occasionally is seen by people on foot.
