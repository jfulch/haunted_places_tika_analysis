description: People that had worked there for years say that odd things happened at night there, but the submitter to the haunted place passed it off as "hazing the new girl." There's one ghost they call the "Miner". He liked to turn off the soda fountain at the drive through during busy times. They have also heard children's laughter in the lobby after the doors are locked. Offerings of toys left on the tables are moved or disappear. They also looked up one night and saw their reflection in the window, along with the indistinct reflection of someone standing behind them, but no one was there when they turned around. - February 2004 Update: The Jack in the Box has been leveled and rebuilt.
