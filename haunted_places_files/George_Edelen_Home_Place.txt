description: The house was moved from Old Lick Creek after a family died of cholera in the 1800's. The house had figurines that swayed more than 45 degrees off their setting, sounds of walking throughout the house, a three pound knocking was heard every night for 30 minutes beginning at 7:30 p.m. Sounds of clearing the throat from someone who was not there. Sounds of mirrors falling and crashing and no evidence of such happenings.
