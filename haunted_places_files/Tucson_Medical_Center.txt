description: A former worker experienced strange and unsettling occurrences for a year. This old hospital that dates back to the 1940's, holds many secrets. An apparition has been seen of an older woman dressed all in black, roaming the hall near unit 450. She would walk through the walls and doors of that hall. Also, in the same hallway, a child would also run through the doors and walls. A black cat is also seen running through the wall of a department at various work shifts. There were also many cold spots in various locations of the hospital. The female co-workers experienced hair- pulling, and strange whispering in their ears. Office chairs with wheels would roll by themselves.
