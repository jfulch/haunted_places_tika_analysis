description: They do public tours now but it used to be a private residence. John Avery built that house for his wife right after they got married. The two main places are in the kitchen pantry and a middle bedroom upstairs. It's painted green and it seems to that it's young child but that this child was very unhappy because the feeling in that room is very oppressive. The front sitting parlor has a feel to of a presence.
