city: Bartelso
country: United States
description: If you sit out on the road for a little bit with your lights off you will see a car coming towards you and then it goes below a hill and disappears. It is said to be the ghost of a girl who was raped and killed. NOTE: There's a road over a field that appears to be coming straight at you, only it goes down a little hill and then turns left, so the lights appear to disappear, but really, the car has turned.
