description: (Arthur Kill Rd) Specter of a young woman walks thru dining areas, and appears on stairs. - June 2008 Update/Additional Information â€“ A former worker reports experiencing The Female ghost. She is the spirit of the woman who lived in the home. Her husband had built the farmhouse when they were married, but he was called of in the civil war. When the husband returned home, he found his wife in bed with another man. He killed both of them and buried her on the property. The building has gone through a major renovation, but the basement was pretty much a dug out stone lined pit where there were many spirits. They were all either soldiers or slaves that would use the tunnels to hide in. There would be lights shattering for no reason, cold winds piercing your skin, and at one point The worker was actually thrown into a wall and the doors leading to an area in the basement that was cross nailed shut banged as if someone was running to hide in the dark. When you go into the new building now, there is the wedding photo of the spirit who still remains in the building to this day.
