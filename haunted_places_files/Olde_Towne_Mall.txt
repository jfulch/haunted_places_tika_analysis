description: A local merchant was staying late one night to complete some work. He describes hearing the doors to back door of his business shake uncontrollably. When he went to investigate, the same thing happened to the front glass doors where he witnessed the doors shake, but could see right through them to find no one there. There has also been witnesses claiming doors opening in front of people to find no one in site. A student taking a late-night class in the lower level of the mall had left the classroom to use the bathroom. While he was in the stall, He looked through the crack of the stall to see the door to the bathroom open fully, stay open for about 1 minute, then close slowly. He stated he could see right out into the hallway, but no one was there! He describes the door as a heavy, wooden door with a clasp that has to be pushed in before the door can open.
