description: A man named James Van Horn built this mansion in 1820. His wife died at the age of 21, some say under mysterious circumstances. A roofer almost fell to the ground after he saw a woman looking at him out of a window of the empty house. Carpenters fled when a person materialized out of a cloud in a bedroom. They wouldn't go back even to get their tools. Some motorists have tried to avoid a girl running from the mansion, then vanished.
