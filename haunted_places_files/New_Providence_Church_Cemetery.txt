description: The Old White Oak as its called has many strange things happen atop that mountain. Right off 11W in Surgoinsville. A Black dog seems to watch over Captain Maxwellâ€™s grave but disappears right after sighted. Birds erupt at night if one gets within a few feet of the Revolutionary soldiers grave and many have heard footsteps in the leaves that walk along with them at night.
