country: United States
description: Riverwalk -  Oldest hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, supposedly been there since the early 1900(s) and was recently made in the last thirty years a Museum. Been known to be the most active around the hours of late, between 11:00pm and 3:00am. Countless spirits haunt the establishment, as most popular apparitions making appearances seem to be; a man seemingly in his mid-40's wearing a duster pacing the downstairs area. A younger man, whom is in no terms of the word 'shy' as he will in static motion creepily advance to the front door, press palm and face against the glass and scare the passerby if they're caught staring and a little girl with shoulder-length curly hair, wearing a ruffled dress around the ages of 5-7, looking sullenly out the window. Several more can be seen upstairs as well as looming in the hallways, nevertheless, their presence is very clear and realistic like. Some cold spots and overwhelming energies, though experiences vary with the person.
