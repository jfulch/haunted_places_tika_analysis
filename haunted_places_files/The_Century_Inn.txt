city: Scenery Hill
country: United States
description: This is the oldest inn along Route 40. In the restaurant of this bed and breakfast, there is a very cold room. The innkeeper said she had seen someone at the door nearby, the cold is not caused by a draft, and she has trouble keeping that door locked. Directly down the hill from that room, mysterious footprints leading away from the inn wall have appeared in the snow.
