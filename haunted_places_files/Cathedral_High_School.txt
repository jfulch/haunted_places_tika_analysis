description: The This school's most haunted place is the third floor, which is also the floor of the freshmen lockers and most of the freshmen classes. One time an unsuspecting Freshmen went up to go get something from his locker that he had left up there and saw that towards the end of the hall a locker was left open. He started heading down the hall to see whose locker it was when the locker was slammed close and a white figure started running in the opposite direction of where the guy was that was walking down the hall. The guy started running after it but once the ghost turned the corner it disappeared. Another part of Cathedral that is haunted is a staircase that leads up into a separate classroom that is attached to the third floor. Once you walk into this classroom you can feel an eerie presence in the room. The hairs start standing up on the back of your neck and you get the feeling as if someone is either watching you are is right behind you, but no matter how much you search around the room you can find no trace of anything living or once living.
