description: once the only road in or out of Chatsworth. The area has histories involving civil war battles and the Trail of Tears. People have reported seeing the apparitions of Civil War soldiers and Indians. Glowing eyes fly into windshields, unknown things run along the side of cars, loud crashes are heard from the woods, fireballs have been seen rolling across the road. Strange things are seen standing just off the side of the road. The area is always windy and foggy even during calm weather. Several houses around the area are haunted, and one house on the stretch of highway was the site of double ax murder.
