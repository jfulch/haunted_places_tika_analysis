city: San Juan Capistrano
country: United States
description: Woman in White.  Seen in park setting near a lone drinking fountain. It has been a personal experience of mine to see her kneeling and praying facing the fountain. She then rises slowly and advances towards you with a sense of urgency, flowing like a white handkerchief in the wind, even when there is no wind. She then dissipates.
