description: Alice’s grave - the hermitage is not an inn.  it is Alice’s house.  When Alice was young, she was engaged to a guy but her brother didn’t approve.  When she got sick, he threw her ring into the marsh.  Then she died.  If you go to her grave, which is just a flat stone, flush with the ground, with just her name "Alice" on it, walk around (possibly 8 times, your ring will feel a pull on it.
