city: San Diego
country: United States
description: just north of the city of San Diego is a Normandy-sized cemetery that was a favorite place for marines awaiting to leave for westpac ground forces. The marines used to go there on short liberties to lay amongst the grave stones, smoke and get drunk and near midnight witness souls rising from their graves to walk near the one thousand foot cliffs and look out over into the pacific ocean to see if their country was secure and then they would return to their graves. Not to many young marines wanted to talk about this experience back at the old main side of camp Pendleton as the cemetery is the location of thousands of buried marines from the first and fifth marine divisions killed in action during world war two.
