description: Many of Roswell's most outstanding citizens are buried here, including Archibald Smith and his wife Anne Margaret McGill Smith. - red orb across the cemetery grounds floating in between trees. Did not appear to be a light or plane. All present saw it. LOTS of ghostly forms and orbs captured on film and digital. One in particular was a white filmy mist bathing the side of a child's grave. Sparkles appear in thousands when taking pictures almost like confetti.
