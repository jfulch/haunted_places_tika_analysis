description: When you park your car at the beginning of the hill and start walking up the hill; you feel as if someone is watching you.  At the top of the hill when it's dead quite you can hear people talking and no one is around.  Going down the other side and walking until you see a few trees knocked over, you might catch a glimpse of a young girl named Kirsten who was shot there.  In that area there's a feeling of sadness and depression.  heading back to your car down the hill you can hear screams and all the sudden feel a great sense of anger and hatred.  By the time you reach your car you get a strong feeling as though someone has followed you right to your car.
