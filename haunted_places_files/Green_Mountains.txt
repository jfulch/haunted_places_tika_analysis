description: The White Lights - Numerous reports of bright white orbs (a favorite story around the campfire) seen bouncing/floating through the forest near locations where massive Indian graves were located (many were massacred by new settlers who were fighting with the local tribes over hunting and land rights). Also goes hand in hand with a story about a killer bear in a "hunting lodge" in the vicinity. Horses become extremely spooked whenever coming anywhere near the well where the hasty dumping of the bodies took place. Numerous cold spats exist between the woods and the adjacent highway. Definitely what some people might call a "high-activity" area. Lots of pent-up energy.
