description: Built in the early '70's on the site of the old Motley Mansion. The Motleys donated the land for the school after the house was burned down by vandals. The family cemetery is still there and includes a grave for an severed arm! Anyway, the theater of the school is said to be haunted by a man who watches practices of plays, etc. He has been reported several times in the past twenty years or so.
