description: The name of a man that killed a little boy, was written on the tombstone of the child, in child like writing. December 2003 Update: The carving on the back of the headstone has the names of the driver that hit the boy as well as the people who drove past him while he laid on the side of the road dieing. The story says that the inscription on the bottom of the face of the headstone, "MAY THE WORK I HAVE DONE SPEAK FOR ME", is in reference to the map on the back and was not original to the stone. On the back of the stone under the map is also an inscription that reads, "BY DOGS MIND". He was walking his dog at the time he was hit.
