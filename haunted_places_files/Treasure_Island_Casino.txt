description: The casino is located about 1 hour from the Minneapolis area near the Wisconsin / Minnesota border. Returning home from the casino (on Hwy 18 along the Mississippi river) alone after midnight, a witness reports he stopped his car on the shoulder of the highway to take a little nap as it was late and he was tired. Shortly after he closed his eyes, he heard the soft muted sound of footsteps walking towards his car. The footsteps sounded like a person with a broken leg because it was dragging one leg as it walked. He got up to see who it was because he didn't want the cops to give him a ticket. He peered out of the car window to see an old man(?) with dark hallow eyes and frayed white hair leaning on the passenger window behind the driver's seat. The old man was rotten and his clothes were tattered! That was all he could make out of the ghost before he quickly started his car and drove off in a hurry.
