She appears for a few seconds and then turns into a glowing ball of light. There are also reports of people seeing the image of a skeleton. The mysterious lady has appeared in the dining area in various forms. Sometimes, just her hand will appear wearing a huge ring. She then materializes in the fountain behind the bar.
