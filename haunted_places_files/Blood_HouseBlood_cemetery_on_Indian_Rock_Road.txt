description: Back along time ago there was a house built next to a cemetery. A family lived there but one night there was someone who broke into the house and the whole family was killed, yet the youngest of the family which was a little boy was running out of the house until he ran into the road hoping for someone to be there to help him unfortunately he was shot in the back. Now in our times a lot of youths like to travel that road at night and sometimes the little boy can be seen on the side of the road and or will jump out in front of your car looking for help, you can see the tire marks from all the times he has jumped in from of the cars. Not only may you see a little boy but also there are clots out there that like to have that cemetery for where they meet.
