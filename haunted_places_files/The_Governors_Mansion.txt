description: This building is quite haunted. Residents have reported, among others: a bewigged 18th century gentleman; a "tippling ghost" that will empty wineglasses left in a certain place; a chain-rattling ghost in the basement (supposedly the place was a stop on the underground railroad; and it's said that some slaves were sold out and recaptured); and a little girl in a red dress who plays in the gardens.
