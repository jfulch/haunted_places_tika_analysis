description: Unfinished Railroad - During the Civil war, Robert E. Lee ordered the construction of a railroad that he could use to more efficiently transport supplies to Bull Run for his army. The workers were massacred and the railroad was never finished. Strange noises including banshee yells and voices have been heard in the woods bordering the paths. There are two intersecting trails through the woods; take the one to the far right.
