city: Marceline
country: United States
description: Just east of Marceline there is a railroad bridge that crosses highway 36. Witnesses have often seen a misty white figure hovering above the road there. Sometimes under the bridge, sometimes just before the bridge. It sometimes vanishes before arriving at the bridge but most times they have driven right through it, and it appeared most every night they drove by.
