description: Wooded area around Wahiawa. This area is home to the Green Lady. The Green Lady was first reported by children at Wahiawa Elementary School, it was sometime in the 40s or 50s. The Green Lady reportedly had green scaly skin like a fish and seaweed-like hair and a really messed up face, sharp looking teeth, blood and other stuff. Several years ago a report in a local paper stating that kids "NOW" have been seeing it right by the playground. All it does is scare the kids it even came out of the woods! She has never gotten real close to the kids but who knows what she wants. and she has a real bad odor so that gives her away if she is near you.
