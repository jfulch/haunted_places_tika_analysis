description: Go to Valley Mines and take a left on the very first road on your left. Possibly a gravel road, and it's hard to see. Awhile down, there is a sign on your right that says Valley Mines tours. Go during the day, and you can get a tour. Such things have happened as we stepped into the house that had all open doors, and it immediately turned 30 degrees colder when we got inside. Also, a gh`st woman on the top floor will pull hair and such. The tour guide has pictures of ghosts who have visited, and they even have psychics come down during Halloween.
