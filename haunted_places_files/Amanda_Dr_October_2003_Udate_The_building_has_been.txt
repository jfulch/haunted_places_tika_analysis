city: Clarksville
country: United States
description: Its an abandoned building in a neighborhood built in the early 1800s. In this building you can hear moaning and groaning going on. You will hear a woman sounding like she is in pleasure. This happens at 11:00pm-12:00am every other day. Sometimes you can see a visual perspective of a young woman. I advise not to go but go at your own risk.
location: Amanda Dr.- October 2003 Udate: The building has been torn down
