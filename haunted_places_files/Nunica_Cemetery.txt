description: The Nunica Cemetery is a small cemetery located east of Spring Lake on M-104, just off of I-96. It is very small, but the big sign on the front, gives it away easily. Many people have reported strange occurances, like dark figures behind tombs, a rope that appears out of nowhere. A spirit entity by the name of "Mr. Bond" has been spotted. He got the name "Mr. Bond" through communication with him. The shed seems to be the most active area, with orbs and mists developed in photos. This is a popular place for people to go to from the nearby cities. But with all the popularity, the activity doesn't seem to cease.
