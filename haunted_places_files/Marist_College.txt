description: As the story goes; Shelly was killed by a jealous boyfriend in the school's cafeteria. Since then, she has been a presence in Sheahan Hall, where she lived. Most of her activity involves folding clothes, opening/closing doors, screwing with televisions and occasional bumps in the night. She may also be linked to some strange occurrences at a grotto dedicated to those who died at Marist.
