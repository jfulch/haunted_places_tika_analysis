description: During renovation work in the 1980's, workers and crew saw the ghost of Percy Keene, a stage manager who died in the 1960's. They saw his face in windows sometimes and thought it was a night watchman, but the opera house didnâ€™t hire any night watchman. Also during the filming of a movie based on a haunted theatre, the director saw Percy's ghost in the balcony smiling down at him. Other ghosts are in the basement. Percy's the only one who can roam, apparently.
