description: This old school/sanitarium is abandon and old. A catholic school where the nuns used to hit the boys and torture them. It was said that one of the nuns hung herself out there and it was also said that you could here the little boys voices at night. There's a church by it and a grave yard where the nuns are buried. January 2004 update: - It isn't advised to go to the Church, nor anywhere on the grounds. The people that own this place now are not allowing visitors, unlike the previous owner. You will be fined.
