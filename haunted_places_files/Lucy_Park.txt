description: cemetery behind Lucy Park - There is also a statue that's called "Little Sister". It's a statue of a young women and it is said that she died from a fever she caught in England when she went there to purchase items for her home after her marriage. If you go there at midnight and you truly feel sorry for her the statue will cry. - June 2008 Update: Although it has long been a ghost story, Flora Kemp was never engaged, never married. She was on a vacation in Detroit, Michigan with her family when she died of typhoid fever in 1910. Even today, people visit her gravesite and put pennies at the base of the statue called, "Little Sister" which is a statue of a young girl walking down a staircase. It is said that she can sometimes be seen at night with a tear streaming down her cheek. The submitter to this update saw the tear once, and since has been back and hasnâ€™t seen it.
