description: One day a little boy was walking up on Waterdog, alone, unprotected. He never returned home. People say the ghost of Waterdog killed him, others say the ghost is bogus. The story posted in the newspapers is a 12 year old boy was killed by a man that was convicted of the act and his body was dumped here. (the boy's name is withheld out of respect for the family). When they go on Waterdog to prove it...they don't return either. Now people say they here screams & gun shots, they don't return
