description: In 1999 prior to its reopening as a new dinner theater. After rehearsal the submitter double checked that all the doors were locked and that everyone was out of the building. While painting the stage floor about 1 am, they heard strange noises upstairs as though someone was walking around. they also heard doors shut and voices. When they looked towards the front of the theater, they saw movement. they yelled who is there with no response. They went up and checked the lobby where They heard the voices, nobody was there and the doors were still locked. They went upstairs to see if or who was up there and there was nothing. When they went to finish painting they heard and saw the same things. The theater was one of the first buildings built on main street in PG. It has always been a theater of some sorts. Many people who have worked there have witnessed strange things in one form or another.
