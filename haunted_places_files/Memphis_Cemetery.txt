description: If you take M-19 (Van Dyke Rd.) and follow it through Richmond to Memphis, the cemetery is on the right side. It is a small cemetery, but there is a narrow dirt road that runs through. At the very back center of the cemetery there is a huge black marble stone called the "witch's ball". If you get close enough you can see faces and shadows in the stone, just like a crystal ball. Voices have been heard and apparitions have been seen there too.
