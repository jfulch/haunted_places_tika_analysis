description: Heard Bridge Rd near old Mt. Pisgah - In the 1950s and 60s, ghost lights were seen in this beautiful quiet country area. Not sure if they are still seen. Some said the lights were phosphorus from nearby mines, but there were no mines then. Some have spoke of lights (phosphorus) following them at dusk.
