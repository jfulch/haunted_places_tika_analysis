description: Believed that in the 1900's sometime the caretaker of the cemetery had a hook in place of his hand and would sometimes kill a person who stayed later than the others to speak words to the one laid to rest. Also in the field behind the cemetery used to be a house where a family once lived and rumor\fact has it that the young son of the family killed the remaining family members including him. The house was knocked down years ago but on Halloween it appears briefly as a phantom. Anomalies have shown.
