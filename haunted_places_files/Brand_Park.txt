description: The park used to be the estate of the brand family, with the library having been the mansion they lived in. There is a trail behind the house leading up in to the hills. If you follow it, it will take you to the family cemetery. Mr. Brand's tomb is a large pyramid where occult activity is pretty common. Also, further up in the hills is what looks to be a 3-foot tall stone watchtower.
