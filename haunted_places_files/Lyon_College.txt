description: Used to be an old orphanage that burnt down in the early 1900's. It is said that late at night, up in the chapel, you can hear what sounds like a rocking chair going back and forth. Then, down in the auditorium on a certain night, the walls look like they are burning down. Around the chapel, there are four posts and there's only a shadow of three. Childrenâ€™s voices, laughing and screaming has also been heard.
