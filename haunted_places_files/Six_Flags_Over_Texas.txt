description: In the Texas section next to the entrance of the "Texas Giant" is a yellow candy store. It is the oldest building in the park. It was said that in the early 1900's a young girl (8 or so) drowned in Johnson's Creek. She supposedly can be seen walking the railroad tracks or in her room in the yellow house turning the light on and off or opening the curtain and then closing it. Security guards at night also have problems locking the upstairs door because "ANNIE" feels playful.
