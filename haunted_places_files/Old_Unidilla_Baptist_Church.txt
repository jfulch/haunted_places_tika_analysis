description: A ghost haunts this site. 1994 or 1995 four teenagers went out there to see if they could see the ghost and one of the graves had been dug up and a skull was sitting on top of a head stone. You will get in trouble if caught there now. - December 2003 Update: The church is no longer standing, it was torn down years ago. The old cemetery is still there, and it is still active. The church was located in the middle of nowhere. When you approached it, it seemed to glow.
