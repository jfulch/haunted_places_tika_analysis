description: Elliot Hall - A male student came to school after having fought in WWII. He was burned during the war and his face was disfigured. Supposedly, he became severely depressed and went to the fourth floor and hung himself from the cross members of the ceiling. At night you can hear a table being dragged across the floor to the point where the man was found hanging.
