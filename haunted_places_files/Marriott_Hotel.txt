city: Long Beach
country: United States
description: Room 217 -  Several tries more than necessary to turn the television off; on several occasions while sitting on the bed you can feel something or someone tugging at the bedspread; the feeling of being touched by someone's hand at the top of your back as well as the sense of a presence in the room. Very eerie and experienced by several people on different occasions.
