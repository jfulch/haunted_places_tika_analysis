description: Sometimes you will walk by the nursery and the lights will be off and no one is in there but the rocking chair will be rocking by itself. 1 witness reports, “what really made us believe was when we were playing "Sardines" a hide-and-go-seek type game and we were the first ones downstairs in the church and we checked the bathroom. So we turned on the lights, checked all around no one was in there. Just before we turned off the lights all the stall doors were closed the minute I turned off the light both doors slammed.”
