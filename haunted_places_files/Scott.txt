Hal was a citizen who was extremely upset with city government. He ran for alderman of his ward.(3) He lost by a landslide to the incumbent, but Hal wasn't going to let that stop him. He attended every city meeting that was held in the chamber until he died of a heart attack at 63. Hal has been seen at least 100 times.
