description: It is said that anyone who passes over this bridge will see the ghost figure of a young girl crying, saying "I love you" or a strapping young man jumping off the bridge. The story goes that the two were romantically involved and their families were at odds. The two would rather die than be kept apart so they jumped off the bridge holding hands and whispering, "I love you".
