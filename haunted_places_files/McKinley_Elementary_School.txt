description: in the playground the "rings" they move while no one is on them and they're too heavy to be moved by the wind. It is said that a kid in 3rd grade died because he fell off and broke his head. Also in the cafeteria the trays move without anyone touching them. The benches move with a full load of kids. They say that a girl fell from the stairs and a boy was killed there by getting into a fight and the other kid had a weapon. These were from the years 1973-1984.
