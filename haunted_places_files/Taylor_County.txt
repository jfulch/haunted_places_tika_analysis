description: M&R estates - In the civil war days the confederate soldiers took the war prisoners to this house for execution. They were murdered and hung in the barn behind the house. As the legend goes there are extreme temperature changes in the house, also the screams can be heard at night by people that walk down the road. On some occasions people have been known to see blood drip from the rafters of the old barn. The entire property is haunted and not many people dare to cross its boundaries if you do there is no telling what could happen. It seems as though people that go across its lines have been tortured in the future as in there dreams and everyday life. it will be a life changing experience.
