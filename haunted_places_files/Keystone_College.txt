description: Ward Hall -  Reports of lights turn on and off in the hallway and one time desks were lined up down the center of the hallway. Strange thing is, the doors at the ends of the hallway are bolted shut allowing no one inside. - November 2005 Update: A ghost hunter recently visited Keystone College. A student took initiative to show taped video footage of the basement of Ward Hall. In the video, a light at the end of the hall turned on mysteriously and a black blob-like entity wandered across the end of the hall. The recording equipment was left overnight. No one was there to witness the event live.
