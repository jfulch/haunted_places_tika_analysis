description: Around the 1950's, when Powell was built, a little girl was walking home from swimming lessons, when she was crossing the road on 1st Street and Extension. By the time she was in the middle of the road, a car was speeding towards her. The car hit her, breaking all the bones in her body. People say they have seen the little girl still trying to get home, but by the time she is in the middle of the road, she disappears, crying and saying, "I want to go home!"
