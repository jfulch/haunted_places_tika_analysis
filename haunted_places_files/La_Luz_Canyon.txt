description: It has been reported that a mother and two children were killed when their car was ran off the bridge by a truck coming down from the canyon. People say if you go up the canyon road to where the road divides going down to the hanging tree. It is said that if you stop on the bridge before you turn onto the dirt road you can put baby powder on your car or you can also see it from the dew on your car. Park your car and wait. You will feel forces pushing the car off the bridge in either directions or then if you *dare* get out of your car and look on the bumper you will see handprints and hear children giggling. People say that the giggles are merely signs of the children saying your welcome.
