description: The Dodge House was owned by General Dodge and his family. The community has tours go through it, to make some money off of its beauty and age...The real story is that General Dodge is still there wandering around or sitting in his rocking chair. Around dusk everyday, you can hear 2 men arguing if you stand in the middle of the street. Late at night you can see small flashes of light around the dodge house lawn, and get a very faint smell of fire. Dodge's wife died and in her remembrance they made a statue of her and put it in the front of the cemetery. The statue is known as The Dark Angel. Her eyes follow you no matter what direction you go. Whoever is "blessed" by here is on the sickly side from then on.
