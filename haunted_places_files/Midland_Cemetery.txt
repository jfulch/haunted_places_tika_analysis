description: There is a lot of activity at the Midland Cemetery! the constant feeling of being followed, including hearing footsteps; screams coming from the back section, several voices that sounds like a group of friends chit-chatting coming from the south-west (front-right) section; sudden cold-spots galore; bird-like noises at 11-12midnight (when birds just don't sing); balloons floating crazily about when there is no wind at all; One investigator claims to have recorded a very clear evp of two voices calling their name and asking for help; orbs-a-plenty in the military section.
