description: This theatre is haunted by a spirit who was stabbed and later died when the theatre first opened. Most of the activity occurs around theatres 8 and 9. Theatre 9 is always eerily cold, even with the heaters on. Upstairs in the projection booth above #9, lights turned off by employees sometimes mysteriously come back on. It is also said you can see a figure's shadow when movies are on against the wall in theatre #6.
