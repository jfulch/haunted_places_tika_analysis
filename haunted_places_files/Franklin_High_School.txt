description: This school is haunted by a former student who died when she fell off a balcony on the fourth floor overlooking the quad. Some students claim that if you go to the balcony today and look down on the quad, you will feel the presence of someone standing next to you. If you look over quickly, you will catch a glimpse of the dead girl staring down--before she disappears.
