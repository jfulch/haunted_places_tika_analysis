description: The ghost of a Confederate soldier has been seen. A Vietnam veteran-- a fellow soldier-- reported that a man in grey was walking around the cemetery and at one point appeared and saluted him.  The man in grey admonished him to "be careful." There is a Confederate soldier [casualty] buried in the cemetery (d. 1863) and several Confederate veterans are also buried there.  The man in grey doesn't seem to be malevolent; he actually seems to be patrolling the area on behalf of the living. The cemetery is family-owned, but it is accessible to the public.  It is on Old Vineland Road, behind the Shingle Creek United Methodist Church.
