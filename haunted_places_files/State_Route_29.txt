description: Near the intersection of Route 29 and Route 38 is a small plot of land between two cornfields. The area to the plot is lined with trees that lead back to a circle of trees that used to encompass a house. The house burnt down many years ago, killing the family as they slept. Supposedly at midnight on a full moon, you are able to see the outline of the old house standing in the circle of trees.
