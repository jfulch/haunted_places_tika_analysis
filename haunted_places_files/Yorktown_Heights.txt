description: Nutley Circle - In this fairly new (30 year old) development of houses, one in particular has been documented by several witnesses of being occupied by spirits.  During the early morning hours, the chairs around the kitchen table can be heard moving from the table and scraping along the floor.  Whenever investigated, no one has been found in the room.  This has been happening from the early 1970's to date.
