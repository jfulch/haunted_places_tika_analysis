description: Sutter Coast Hospital Old site and new ICU ward - The old site of the hospital always gives passer-bys eerie feeling now a hotel is being constructed right on the site,(that is sure to be haunted) but the new hospital's ICU ward is definitely haunted. A worker at the hospital was in ICU when it was closed down due to lack of patients, so therefore it was empty. They were minding their own business when the patient call light and buzzer went off when they walked to the empty room the buzzer stopped and the buzzer in the room two doors down went off, so they walked back to the nurses station and the buzzer stopped. (The buzzers can only be turned off from the nurse's station) They thought someone was playing a trick on them but when they investigated the whole place was empty.
