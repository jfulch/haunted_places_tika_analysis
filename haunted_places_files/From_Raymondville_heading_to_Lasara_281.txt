description: On the way to Lasara Many people have seen a man walking on the side of the road. If you stop and pick him up he seems almost real. All he ask is that you give him a ride to the Lasara cemetery. While in the vehicle though you feel a sense of sorrow and coldness. Then as the man gets out of the car he disappears without a trace.
