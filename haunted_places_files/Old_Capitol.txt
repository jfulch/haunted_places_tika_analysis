description: This building was used as the state capitol from 1839-1903, and is now a museum open to the public. At one time during the 1800's, a legislator died from a heart attack in his office, and slumped from his desk, hitting the floor. To this day, sometimes around 5:15 in the afternoon, a thud is heard coming from that office. Security officers have also reported hearing doors slamming and hammering in the night.
