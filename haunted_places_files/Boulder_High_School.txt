country: United States
description: Theatre -  while seated in the house after a late rehearsal back in the late 1980's, a witness heard loud footsteps on stage and rumbling and crashing above in the catwalks in the proscenium arch. Others have said they would get a feeling of dread in the tunnel, which connected the dressing rooms under stage to the school lobby. There is a labyrinth of tunnels rumored to be between the high school and the University of Colorado up the street; this was one of them evidently.
