description: Crooked Creek - Going back to 1958 reports of a woman in white walking the road at night and she has accepted rides to say I am going home. She gets out at this deserted house for 60 years and goes in. No lights go on or nothing and she isn't seen again accept on rare times. Everything about her is white they say. The story is on one website that has been around a few years. I think its called bluebird something. The ghost of Edgewood seems to be harmless and she doesn't appear often. But after reading about other ghost this seems to be normal.
