description: This is a brick building that was built in 1906 and was the home of Finnefrock Furniture for many years. There have been reports of apparitions in period clothing, unexplained footsteps, lights turning on and off, radio stations changing and unexplained noises. This was also home to a mortuary in the lower basement from 1916-1936. There have been high EMF readings and temp drops noted at the same time. Spirit energy has produced orbs in photographs and also caused someone with physic abilities to feel "bombarded" on a recent visit. the submitter claims to have dowsed this building several times and found many spirits present and moving. This building now houses a antique mall and shops along with a wonderful teahouse. Canal Fulton is a very historic town located on the Ohio Erie Canal and was a boom town for miners and canalers back in the mid 19th century. Not everything is so quaint in this town though after experiencing this building energies! Haunted Rogues Hollow, Cry Baby Bridge and Lock 4 are not far away.
