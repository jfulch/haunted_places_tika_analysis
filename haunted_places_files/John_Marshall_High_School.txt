description: Students believe the fourth floor is haunted because of it being restricted. any info please email Haunted Places- April 2005 Correction â€“ The rumor is that a boy was murdered up there in the 4th floor. On the 3rd floor witnesses would hear noises down the hallway, as if someone was touching the lockers. Like someone was trying to open the locker type noise. When the submitter of this update would go to the 3rd floor they always wondered why the stairs that lead to the 4th floor would be caged shut. While they attended that school, not once had they ever seen the stairs that lead to the 4th floor ever cleaned. The 3 yrs they attended the same filth would be there. The school was built sometime in 1936.
