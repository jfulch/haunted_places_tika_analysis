description: Things in the prop room move all by themselves, when you walk down to the basement, you feel an icy breeze rush past your head or an icy hand grabs your shoulder. A grown man will not go down there alone. They say its owner haunts it. There isn't any proof that there are tunnels under the theatre, but it's said the pipes are big enough for a grown man to crawl through. The owner also owned its' sister, The Colony Theatre, across the street. It's said that at night he travels through the pipes in between the theatres to see how they're being held up. After the young thespians and the audience leaves you can see a phantom like figure in the ticket booth.
