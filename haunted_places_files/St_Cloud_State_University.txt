description: Shoemaker Hall - In the early 1900's a student at the St. Cloud Normal School had an affair with a janitor at Shoemaker Hall, which was the dormitory for the students. She became pregnant and hung herself in the meat locker of the kitchen(now the basement). Shoemaker is still a dorm, and many students report objects being moved, clocks flashing impossible numbers, lights and TVs turning on for no reason, and an apparition of a woman floating above beds late at night.
