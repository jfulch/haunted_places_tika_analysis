description: It's located in Morningside near the collage and it has been in a magazine. It has been investigated before. There has been sightings of a Red glow in the upstairs. The workmen who did some remodeling there would always find there tools in the basement in the mornings. The birds they tried to keep would always die on them and the dog would never go into the house. In the middle of July the attic would be so cold that you could see your breath. The house has been surrounded by death. There has been many murders there. There has been a count of seven entities there.
