description: Supposedly, a high school student named 'Harvey' had just been dumped by his girlfriend. He was so depressed that he jumped off the bluff behind Mission Point. He became a nuisance; People who worked in the carpenter shop would clean up sawdust, and it would be scattered around the place the next morning as if it had never been touched after work. Also, things would be moved to another place, or disappear. Other sightings included soldiers being seen walking around Mission Point's theatre and other places.
