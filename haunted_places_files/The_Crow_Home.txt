description: Rumors has it that this theater located in the middle of the city is haunted by a man. The theater was once some kind of army hospital way back when. It gained publicity by local radio station...Voices and even sightings have been heard there. Right next to the Fort Donnellson National Cemetery, just below the fort, this house was used as a hospital after the battle! Now a posh bed & breakfast! you can hear doors open by themselves, & soft voices crying throughout the home!
