description: In early 1900's the present preacher had caught his wife cheating on him and he couldn't deal with the grief. So that coming Saturday he decided to commit suicide, by slitting his wrists and hanging himself from the rafters, off the front pew. On Sunday morning, the congregation of the church came in to find their preacher dead. To this day you can go up there and see the blood stain on the floor and the indentions on the rafters along with the scratches on the pews, from the hard soled shoes he was wearing. At night people say you can see him swinging and there is a Bible at the podium that will tell you when, where, and how you will die!
