description: 2003 - The manager was sitting in a chair behind the bar one day before opening. The bar was empty; He was watching TV for maybe an hour and a half in that one spot when he heard a knock at the door he got up to see who was there. Before he got to the door a large iron industrial fan directly above his chair fell from the ceiling crushing his chair. No one was at the door or anywhere near the bar when he checked.
