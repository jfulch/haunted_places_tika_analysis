description: you can be walking down the street by the pool and you will feel a sudden feel of cold energy and a feeling you are being watched all the time. When you are in the bike trails you can occasionally hear something walking near to you and people's dogs always bark out of nowhere and you look outside to see what it is nothing is there. Lights will flicker, you can hear loud noises outside, so on.. many people have reported seeing ghost.
