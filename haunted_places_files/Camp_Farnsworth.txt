description: Keushk - In the theater/gathering hall called the Keushk, people have reported cold spots and feelings of unease when alone.  People have also claimed that sounds from outside sound muted when in the keushk and that the doors don't stay open.   There have been reported sightings of a woman holding a kerosene lamp who walks slowly towards lone walkers between the living units tree houses and windigo.  She has been dubbed "the lady of the lamp" and it is thought that she might be the camp's matron- Madama Farnsworth, or a camper/counselor who died on camp at some time during its history.
