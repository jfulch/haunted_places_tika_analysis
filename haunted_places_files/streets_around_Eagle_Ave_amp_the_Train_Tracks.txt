Others have seen the old man walking in front of there houses in every case the man looks at the onlooker then dissipates. The neighborhood dogs wont even go out side at times and in some rare cases when people noticed that there dogs wouldn't even come into different rooms in there houses they have reported seeing the man in there house.
