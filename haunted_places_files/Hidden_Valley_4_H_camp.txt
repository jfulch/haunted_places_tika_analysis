description: Back when the camp first opened, the campers would go camping at a large flat clearing in thee woods. About 10-15ft from the area at which the camper's sleep is a steep hill (about 80deg.), with a large creek at the bottom. A boy known as Riley was found at the bottom of that hill in the creek one morning after a campout. He was though to have slept walked off the side of the hill. After his death a healthy cluster of trees started to grow in one knot like tree. The tree now resembles a throne, but what is weird about it is, the part you would sit on looks like a face(said to be the devils throne).
