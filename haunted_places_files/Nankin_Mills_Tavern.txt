description: A strange ghost hangs around this place a lot. He bangs things in the kitchen and slams doors in the basement. He is a friendly ghost but likes to make noise. He's believed to be a mill worker from the mill a block away. He was crushed in a freak accident around the turn of the century. In hunting adventures with all the lights off we got a picture of his face in ectoplasm. In another you can see his hand, very clearly.
