description: Sunrise Hall Dormitory - A long time ago the dorms used to be a house of ill repute. There were said to be lots of murders in that house. Later it burned down to nothing. Time passed and a hotel was built there and it eventually became the A.I. dorms. There have been numerous reports from the second floor that the sound of moans come from the third floor around 1am. The sound of metal pipes being dropped and rolling across the floor can be heard in the ceiling. And the sound of high heels walking around the second floor hallway, if you wait 10 minutes the noise comes back again but it sounds more like running.
