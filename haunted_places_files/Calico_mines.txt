description: Behind the actual "ghost town" the pitted landscape of tunnels and pits, there is a small road that ends at an open area. On the Winter solstice (Dec 21 or 22 depending on the year} a bizarre collection of ghosts, animal and human act out what seems to be a ritual of some kind. First a slowly moving bear crosses the length of the open area, to seemingly clear the stage for the others to come.
