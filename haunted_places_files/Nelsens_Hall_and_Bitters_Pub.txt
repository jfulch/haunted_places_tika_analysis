description: As the oldest continuously operating Tavern In the US, This place seems to be haunted by Its founder Tom Nelsen. Objects disappear and reappear in different places. A hotel guest cut short a stay after an encounter in the back ladies bathroom, and a former employee was tapped on the shoulder when building shelves in the hand dug basement. I was alone at the time, so there is no explanation for the tapping.
