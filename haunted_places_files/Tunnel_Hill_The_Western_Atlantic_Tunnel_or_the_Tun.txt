description: the tunnel and the surrounding area was the site for numerous civil war battles, and in the 1900s a man riding on a circus train was supposed to have been decapitated there in an accident. Ghostly forms are seen inside the tunnel. On the fields surrounding the area, several bloody battles were fought. People have reported seeing ghostly campfires and lanterns that disappear when you get near them, the smell of rotting flesh that only some can smell, sightings of confederate and union soldiers that vanish into thin air, and strange screams from the woods.
