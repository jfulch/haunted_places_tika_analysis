description: In the early 1900a, a young woman named Charlotte leaped to her death from an eighth floor window on her wedding day when she found her new husband in bed with a bridesmaid in the honeymoon/presidential suite on the seventh floor. A veteran housekeeper knows that she sometimes plays tricks with the locks on the doors to the guestrooms; supposedly she rides the elevator to the eighth floor at midnight but has been felt at other locations in the hotel.
