description: An apparition haunts the 16th floor of Keene hall at Eastern Kentucky University. A student in his early twenties, late teens, committed suicide from the top floor of the University's dorm hall over a distraught fight with his girlfriend. Feelings of being watched, girls would wake up in the middle of the night and see a man in the room, then they would look twice then nothing was there, weird sounds. Very creepy if you're up there alone.
