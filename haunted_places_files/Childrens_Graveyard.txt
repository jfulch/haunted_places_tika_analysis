description: A graveyard behind Hickory Point gas station near Furman U., mainly for children. Tombstones range from the late 1700's to late 1800's. Lights, laughter, running sounds. - May 2008 Additional Info - If you drive just past it there is a short unmarked road. The trail leading into the graveyard is at the end of this road to the right. A visitor did not observed any "No Trespassing" signs, however there is some sort of police station not a hundred yards down the road. This location is haunted, but there are dangerous things in there that are not paranormal. There have been bobcats seen out there, so a fare warning to anyone that goes, be alert.
