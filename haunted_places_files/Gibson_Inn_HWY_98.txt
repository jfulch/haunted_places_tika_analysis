He appears to the workers there and guest he pull there blankets off them at night and moves your shoes and stuff in a neat place he’s a good ghost doesn’t bother anyone but be careful not to trash he room 128 or hell destroy your things and hell mess with you the whole stay. The workers there well tell you the stories and you always feel someone watching you at night.  November Correction/Update: Room 309 is haunted by the ghost of Captain Wood. He died of pneumonia after returning from sea in that room. He is a friendly ghost that moves things in the room such as shoes or tucks guests into bed. He stays in that room. We also have the ghost of a woman that roams the second floor. She has been seen wearing a long gray dress with her hair pulled back in a bun. This is reportedly Sunshine Gibson, one of the Gibson sisters that owned the hotel in the 1920's. A worker at the front desk claims one of the ghost has been calling their phone all night. Sometimes when the phone rings, the switchboard lights up from rooms that are unoccupied. The only thing they hear on the receiver is a crackling noise. They’ve gotten phone calls from the kitchen and the phone in the kitchen is not working. They also received a phone call from the boss' office even though he had left 2 hours earlier. The speaker on the phone has come on by itself a couple of times also.
