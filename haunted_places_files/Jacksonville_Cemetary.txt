description: Eerie things seen in the back of the cemetary, a stream in the back of the woods seems to pull you towards it. Often eerie sounds heard at night, and a black cat with glowing green eyes seems to watch anyone who walks in. As you near the back, more creepy feelings seem to come upon you. Often a teenage girl is seen wandering seemingly aimlessly throughout the nights, watching, sometimes following people. In the back woods, gunshots are often heard, and screams following.
