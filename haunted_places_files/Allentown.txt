description: Manorcare Health Services - the ghost of a small boy has been seen in the kitchen. the boy was about 8 or 9 years old, had brown hair and was wearing modern clothing. Each time they encountered this boy he appeared whole to them, just like a normal human being. there wasn't anything else about the boy's appearance that was odd or out of the ordinary. when workers encountered the boy, he would look directly at them then run from them and attempt to hide elsewhere in the kitchen. When they would try to find the boy he was nowhere to be found. Because this activity only happened on the later shifts (2nd&3rd) it would have been all but impossible for anyone, especially a child, to get into any of the buildings without being noticed.
