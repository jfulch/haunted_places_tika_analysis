Some homes that back up to the Rainbow Lake area have reported seeing paranormal figures, hearing shrieks during the night, and cold spots in the heat of summer. Rumors of a dead body being found further upstream in the Rainbow Creek area have also turned up as well as a sighting of a ghost-like male deeper into the woods.
