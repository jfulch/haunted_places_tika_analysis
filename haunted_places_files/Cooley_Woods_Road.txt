description: This entire length of road is said to be haunted. The fields sometimes glow an eerie shade of green at night. An old home-place was once located in one of the fields and was occupied by an old woman. It is said the house burned down killing the woman and if you stand in the field late at night you can her the old woman creaking back and forth in her rocking chair. The old woman's specter's is also said to sometimes take the form of a black panther, and roams the area. There is also a pond located in one of the fields, and it's said at night green lights rise from the water and float across the fields and into the woods. Be aware the vast majority of this area is PRIVATE PROPERTY.
