city: Medora
country: United States
description: It is supposed to be haunted by a person (possibly a woman) who haunts only once a year. Her birthday. Even though it is an ice cream shop it is unnaturally cold in there, even in the 100-degree plus heat. The whole town is full of ghosts, ask a local and they will tell you where to look.
