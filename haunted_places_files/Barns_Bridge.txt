description: One night in 1974 and lady and her daughter were driving on Barns Bridge and flipped into the creek and they both died. Legend is that at midnight you stop on the bridge and turn your car off and sit there roll down the windows and drop your keys onto the road. Wait for 3 minutes and get your keys and they say that when you get home you will have a set of 3 finger prints all over your car.
