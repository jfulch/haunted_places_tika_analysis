description: The Cemetery is very old and has grave stones going back to the late 1800s/early 1900's and is very haunted But one of many is there is a family grave site where many people have said to have witnessed a young girl sitting over a grave crying(believed to be her mother) . Many people have tried to give their assistance to the girl but she only looks at them and disappears . Another site is of a 19 year old girls grave from the late 1800s , she is said to have been a preachers daughter but betrayed him in not believing the religion he taught, so her family disowned her and she killed herself . The bible on top of her grave is said to be broken in half sometimes and sometimes appears perfectly normal.
