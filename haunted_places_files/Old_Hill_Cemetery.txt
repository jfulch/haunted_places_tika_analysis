description: This cemetery, the oldest in Newburyport (which rests across the street from the historic "Olde Goal" and alongside the Barlette Mall), has a history of, well, unadulterated strangeness. There are cases where visitors have been temporarily "possessed" and taken on different personalities while at the cemetery. The cemetery is infamous for an occurrence in 1984 when a bunch of drunken teenagers forced entry into the Pierce tomb one night and proceeded to desecrate the corpses found in there. There was also a homeless woman who used a particular "table-tomb" as a bed. The most famous headstone in the cemetery is the one describing the lady who died by choking to death on a pea. It's a very interesting place. While fully open to the public 24 hours a day, the cemetery is in a wretched state.
