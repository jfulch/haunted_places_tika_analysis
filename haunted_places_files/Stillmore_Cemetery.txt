description: Old Kenfield Rd - While walking through the black half of the cemetery (being a relatively old cemetery in the south (some new graves, though), it is segregated)which is on the left-hand side of the road (going downhill), on a very warm August afternoon, my kids and walked through what was a very cold, moist spot. It was way out in the middle of the cemetery, no trees or other shade around, no tombstones close by. It only lasted a brief moment, and surprised us so much that we didn't realize what had occurred for a minute. We then walked the whole area again, finding nothing.
