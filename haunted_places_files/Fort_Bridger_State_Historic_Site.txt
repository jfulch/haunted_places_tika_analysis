description: Ghosts in almost every standing historic structure. One in the museum building that likes to play with copiers. One or more animal ghosts, particularly that of a dog that was decorated for heroism for saving a young boy. Most ghosts seem to be rather harmless. Most are soldiers that died while stationed at the site in the mid to late 1800's.
