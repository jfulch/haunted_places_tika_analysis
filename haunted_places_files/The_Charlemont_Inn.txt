description: There seems to be quite a few rather friendly spirits in this original 1787 Inn. A few of these visitors have been captured on film. Most active is "Elizabeth‚Äù, who must be a 17 year old "Brat". She likes to slam doors, stomp up and down the hallways and move or throw things to bizarre locations. She also likes to talk to young children, who always report with the same words, "I was talking to the Lady". There is also a Civil War soldier seen in the upstairs hallway, and a past innkeeper often seen in the tavern.
