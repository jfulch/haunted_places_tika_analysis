city: Wateree River Swamp Bridge
country: United States
description: Where US 76 crosses the Wateree River between Sumter and Richland counties, South Carolina, the westbound bridge has been haunted by a phantom hitchhiker, a young woman who is trying to get to Columbia to see her ill mother. She appears solid and holds a brief conversation before she disappears when the Good Samaritan who picks her up drives over the bridge. She has been reportedly seen since the 1930's when the bridge was new.
