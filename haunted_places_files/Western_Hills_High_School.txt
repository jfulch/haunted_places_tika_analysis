description: There are adjoining doors to the now-empty swimming pool from the boys and girls locker rooms. One day, a foreign exchange student decided to skip gym class. He opened the first door, and the area was very dark. He heard a noise, and began running, stumbling right into the swimming pool. A janitor heard screaming, opened the door and turned on the light. The student was being pushed under water by something invisible. To this day, at 1:24 in the afternoon, you can hear screaming and splashing.
