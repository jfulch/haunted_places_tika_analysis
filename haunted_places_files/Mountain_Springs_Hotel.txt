city: Ephrata
country: United States
description: built somewhere around 1850 as a hydropathic retreat because of the medicinal qualities of the pure springs from the mountain. It later became the Ephrata Hospital, The hospital closed there when the new hospital was built in 1949. It was a famous resort where people came from all over the country. When the hospital closed, the grounds and buildings were purchased by a group of spiritualists who renamed it "Camp Silver Belle," after an Indian spirit guide. This hotel was open only in the summers during this period before it closed for good. If you are not to scared to go inside, you will feel cold breezes, see shadows and hear sounds. - February 2007 update: The Mountain Springs Hotel was torn down in 2004 to make way for the Hampton Inn & Suites at Mountain Springs and an Applebee's restaurant. The mansion remains and has been turned into office space.
