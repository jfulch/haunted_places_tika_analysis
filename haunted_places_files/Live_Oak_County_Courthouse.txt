description: People have reported hearing the sounds of children playing and laughing although there were never any children harmed or killed within the courthouse. There is also a picture in the District Courtroom of an ex District court justice who's eyes will follow you all over the courtroom. It has also been told that if you walk on the south hall on the second floor you will hear footsteps following you. The City founder George Washington West has been seen in the same hallway, I witnessed this for myself while standing on the ground outside the courthouse one night.
