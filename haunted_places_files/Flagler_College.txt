description: Ponce de Leon Hall - once Ponce de Leon Hotel, has numerous ghost stories, most of which are in Ponce de Leon hall, the girls' dormitory. One such story is how the mistress of Henry Flagler haunts the 4th floor where she hung herself. The room is boarded up, but some students venture up to peek in the keyhole still. Also believed, When Flagler died; his funeral was held in the front hall of the college (the one with the tile floor). They had all the windows open so his spirit could "fly away" instead of being trapped in the hall forever. As a janitor was passing by during the funeral, he noticed that all the windows and doors were open, so he closed them. People felt a big gust of wind, supposedly Flaglerâ€™s spirit. It had not made it in time, all the windows and doors where shut. It is said that his spirit hit a window and bounced back and landed in one of the tiles. So to this day, you in a certain tile to the left of the doors and towards the back of the hall, there is the face of Henry Flagler.
