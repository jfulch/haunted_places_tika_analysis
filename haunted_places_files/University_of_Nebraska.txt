description: The Temple Building - A worker fell from the rafters during construction early in the 1900's and was killed as he hit the stage floor. People have heard a noise followed by a crashing sound from the stage. As they come to investigate, there is no one there or anything out of place. A misty figure of a worker in old style clothes has also been seen. - February 2004 update: The ghost's name is Clara and they recently put an office in for her (Clara's Office) With a piano and many different instruments. If you're alone in the building you can hear her playing the organ.
