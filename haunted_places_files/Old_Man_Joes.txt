description: It is known that Joe was ridding down the dirt road and was trying to light his pipe but dropped his lighter. He leaned over to pick it up and ran off the road. He then crashed into the creek and the impact killed him. When you visit him you roll the windows up, lock the doors, and put the keys on the hood. (everyone has to get out the car) strike your lighter 3 times saying "Old Man Joe I got a light for your pipe!" (you repeat the saying 3 times) After the 3rd time you will hear him running through the water toward you.
