description: Haunted by 38 known ghosts, including Teddy Roosevelt, a lady in blue, Sallie White who is a murdered chamber maid, Captain Richard King, and many others. My sister, who is a little psychic, had an experience here. Our family was sleeping in the new portion of the hotel, and she woke up in the early hours and saw a misty "cowboy" like-person standing in the room with his back turned to her. He had a blank stare on his face and just stood for several minutes before leaving. Many of Teddy Roosevelt's rough riders haunt the bar.
