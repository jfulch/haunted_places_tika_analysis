description: In the 60's a serial killer named Leroy Martin murdered several women in Gaffney, SC.

One of these sites is a bridge just off HWY 329 in Gaffney, the place where the first body was found in a shallow creek under the bridge. It is said that if you walk across the bridge at night you can hear the sounds of a girl moaning in pain and begging for help.
