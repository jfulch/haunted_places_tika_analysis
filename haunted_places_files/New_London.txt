To honor his death the building was given his name and a portrait of him stirringly hangs on the quarterdeck. His eyes appearing to watch your every move many have experienced his presence as they tour the building during their rove of inspection. A number of active duty Navy students have experience equal or deeper experiences. One prominent story raises among all others the night of the Rear-Admiral's Birthrate a classified number of students report seeing the Admiral's appearance while on separate levels of the building and being quick to share their sittings amongst them they quickly established that they had seen him at synchronized time periods exactly zero one hundred.
