A young girl on vacation with here family stepped out of the shower, and had to step over a bunch of "towels"...then she noticed they were bloodied bandages and sheets. A security guard stepped out of an elevator, only to have the room before him transformed into one of the hospital wards, full of wounded soldiers.
