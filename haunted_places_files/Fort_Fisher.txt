Whiting, the Confederate officer in charge of the fort. Years ago, a Kure Beach an on-duty police officer was driving toward the fort at night, and noticed a man walking down the side of the road. The office pulled over to give the man a ride, and he climbed in. The officer continued driving until the man motioned that he wanted to be dropped off at a spot near the fort. When the man got out of the car, the police officer was able to see that the man was dressed in a complete Confederate general's uniform. The officer swore he would never go back there at night. The staff and visitors have reported hearing footsteps inside the visitors center when no one else is there, and some people have felt a sensation that someone just walked past. Every night at closing the staff says good night to Gen. Whiting.
