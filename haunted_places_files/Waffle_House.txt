description: Last year, two employees were shot and killed in the freezer by a crazed former employee, early in the morning at around 4:00. Since the murders, employees and diners have reported a "creepy feeling around the place" and employees have sensed a presence while there without customers, during opening and closing. Blood stains can still be seen on the floor of the cooler, although covered with boxes.
