description: formerly Tulare County General Hospital - This set of buildings was at one time the county hospital. It is now a public and mental health clinic with many other services housed in the 2nd floor. The basement is currently in use by the maintenance department and there is a tunnel running from what used to be physical therapy to the main building. Many transients live in this tunnel. The main haunting seems to be on the 2nd floor. The elevator goes up and down without anyone using it. The evening cleaning lady will not work past 9:00 p.m. and has felt many vibrations she thought were heavy footsteps coming up the stairs with no one ever appearing. One staff member was taken to the basement in the elevator after pressing floor 1.
