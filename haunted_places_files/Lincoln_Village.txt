description: It has said to be a cemetery under some apartments. Late at night whenever you come home by yourself you can hear strange sounds of babies crying and people begging for help. It is said to be a very spooky place. -  December 2006 Update: There is an old graveyard next to the apartment complex. If you go to the northwest corner of the complex there is a wooded area. The overgrown graves are in the woods about thirty feet back. The graves are sunken and ground is soft. Some of the graves have holes of an unknown depth around them. The apartment complex itself is abandoned and in great disrepair. Be cautious, the neighborhood is one of the rougher ones. The city police frequent the complex and may consider any vehicle parked in the complex to be suspicious. As police are typically inquisitive, you may get a police escort to the graveyard if ask the right cop at the right time. to find the complex go from 5th street in Hartsville onto Washington street. Just after you pass the RR tracks turn right onto 8th street. The complex looms on the right about one-tenth of a mile down.
