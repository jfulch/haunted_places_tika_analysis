city: Burlington
country: United States
description: A man who once worked there killed himself in the basement. The bullet went through his head and into the wall. You can still see the bullet hole in the basement. Most encounters happen in the basement, which houses the kitchen and tapped kegs under the bar. Waitresses reported their skirts being lifted up from a cold wind. Doors always slam closed, trapping waitresses in the basement's walk-in. Waitresses were told not to even go down in the basement anymore. The basement is also connected to other old buildings in downtown Burlington by various tunnels from the prohibition era. There are a lot of reports of hearing people talking throughout the restaurant when no one is there. The ghost seems to mess mostly with women. A lot of breaking glasses, plates flying off of counters and sudden increased oven temps too. Bartender (female) reported a pyramid of water glasses appearing on the bar, right after she had put the glasses away and turned her back for a second.
