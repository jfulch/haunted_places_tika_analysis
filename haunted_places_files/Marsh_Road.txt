description: Studies have been conducted out on the road and have found "orbs" in pictures. - October 2004 update: The local legend behind that is one of a Goatman. Yes a goatman. Legend has it that back in the 60's or 70's maybe even earlier that there used to be a "makeout" couch located halfway down the rd. While late one night after high school prom a young couple was down there and the goatman killed them and the couch was covered with thier remains. Also a myth with the road is you can travel it one was and it will be so many miles long you can turn aroung go back to the other end and the length of the road will be dramatically different As legend has it.
