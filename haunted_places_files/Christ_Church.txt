city: St. Simon's Island
country: United States
description: before it was enclosed by a wall visitors would make midnight trips to see the flickering light of a candle above one of the tombstones, the car had to be driven slowly on the left side of the road with the lights dimmed, the story is that a woman who lived on the island was so afraid of the dark that she always slept with a lit candle by her bed, when she died her husband was distressed at the thought of his wife in the dark, so every night of his life he put a candle on the top of her tombstone.
