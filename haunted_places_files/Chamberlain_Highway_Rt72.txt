description: Coyotes are native to this area. So every fall-spring in the houses around, you hear coyotes yelping in the late night hours, after about 5 minutes of this, you hear a trumpet. Anywhere along RT.72 (Chamberlain Hwy) you hear them.. Legend has it, that at Ragged Mountain off Rt.72 in the late 1800's a young trumpet boy had gotten lost around his new home, and he was lost with his trumpet. And coyoteâ€™s have gotten to him, So this is his call for help, Just to late.
