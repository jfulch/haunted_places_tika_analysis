description: The Villa, back in the early 1900's The Villa was a school for girls, like dormitories. The Villa was a Catholic School. The legend has it that the priests would have intercourse with the nuns, then when the nuns were pregnant, they would physically take the baby out of the womb and burry them into the walls. If you go there at night, you can here the aborted babies knocking on the walls, trying to get out. Toilets flushing for no apparent reason, footsteps, and women screaming. There have also been many suicides that have occurred at The Villa on the 4th floor. - September 2005 Update:Burned to the ground in July 2005
