description: McMorran Theater is a delightfully haunted old theater located in the heart of Port Huron.  They've had some trouble keeping a night time cleaning crew though.  As they would climb the stairs to the balcony, sometimes eyes would appear and once there appeared a woman. Many other apparitions have been seen in the balcony.  ParaHaunt Paranormal Researchers (www.MiParaHaunt.com) was called to investigate.  They captured an EVP of a woman uttering "I don't belong here".  Also, the spiritual orbs could be seen moving through the stairwell, around the corners and through the seats in the balcony.
