description: Reports of cries for help in the bathroom in the old building of a kid who died in the that room. People reported that they see his ghost and hear him moaning. - November 2003 update/correction: It was a girl that committed suicide in the downstairs bathroom in 7 building. It's rumored that there are still bloodstains on the walls that maintenance couldn't get out. So itâ€™s permanently locked. Supposedly people still hear her in there.
