description: Westley Anderson Hall - There is a spirit of an older man that likes to play tricks on people. He will turn the stage lights off when people are on the stage but never during a performance where he just sits and observes. He also likes to whispers in peoples ears and rummage through the costumes in the costume loft. Also reported the figure of a 16/17 year old girl walking around the stage dressed in a '50s style outfit.
