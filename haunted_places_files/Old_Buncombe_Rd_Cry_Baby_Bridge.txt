description: there is an old steel bridge no longer in use that is called Cry Baby Bridge where it is said a young woman jumped from the bridge to her death with her baby. Legend has it that you can hear the sound of a crying baby and see his mother on the old bridge looking down into the dark water searching for her child. Now a modern bridge crosses the river and when you stop on the bridge there is no sound of running water. This whole area is in a small community called Crowville. Once you cross over into Crowville you get the feeling like you aren’t supposed to be there.
