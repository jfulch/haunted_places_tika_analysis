description: Later River City Lighting - Owned by two men one of which killed the other in the showroom. The accused killer was found not guilty. A manager at the showroom from 1979-81 would come in before anyone else to do some work. Very distinct footsteps could be heard in the warehouse above my office. Many people heard this ghost at different times.
