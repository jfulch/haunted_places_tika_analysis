description: A very tall old brick building. People have said that as you reach the second floor where the first cellblock is located 2 or 3 ghosts follow you as you progress up the stairs. You can also look down at the cells and see a red glow as though from a cigarette. Many people are said to have committed suicide and have been murdered in this prison. - June 2008 Update: you are no longer able to enter the building. The door in the back, which was the way to enter the building, has been sealed with cinderblocks.
