description: Carl a former bus person, still haunts the grounds. He has been seen in the kitchen and in the halls. Things fall off the shelves. You see legs on the other side of the work table, but when you crouch down to see who it is and no one is there. Out of the corner of your eye you see someone go into the office, but the door is locked and no one is inside, you can be walking down the hall and see someone coming towards you and then they are not there. Also, a female haunts the site but nothing is known about her except that her spirit isn't as nice as Carl's.
