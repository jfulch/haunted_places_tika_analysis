description: In the late 1800s there was a city its name was happy valley its is said it was a fairly big city. Until the black plague came and seemingly wiped out this city. Now very desolate there are roads thru out 5000 acres of land were "no won lives" there are many sightings of paranormal activity. If you where to get lost on one of its many roads you would be seemly lost for days. Back in 1976 there were some friends driving thru and they stumbled upon a skull one of them put in the rear of there car while they were driving the eyes of the skull lit up bright red. They were spooked and never returned since. To this day no won will go alone on any giving night.
