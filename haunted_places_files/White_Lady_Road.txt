description: The In the old days of traveling salesmen there was one salesman   who fell for a farmer’s daughter...   He took her for a walk on a remote road.   When they came to a bridge over a swampy area he made his move. When the Girl spurned his advances He killed her......  Now at different times when people travel over the road at night they see a woman in white standing on the road. Next thing they know she is on their vehicle looking in with glowing red eyes apparently looking for the murderer....  One group of people knocked her off the vehicle by driving away at great speed and by swerving back and forth but a few miles down the road she jumped back on the car and continued looking over each  person till she was satisfied that who she was looking for was not there. This manifestation has gone on for years and there is many who claim to have seen her
