description: In the little shop on the corner of Wyoming and Green Streets, next to I believe Cousins Bar, there is said to have been various sightings of people walking through the storefront, in the kitchen, and in the basement. There was supposedly a mass murder in the building back in the late 1930's. While nobody has actually physically encountered any of them, they are said to be very temperamental and violent.
