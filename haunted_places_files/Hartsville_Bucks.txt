country: United States
description: Hartsville Inn - The site is a very old building from around the civil war era. There are tunnels from the underground railroad where travelers would pass through. They are said to be sightings of ghosts. It then was a restaurant/hotel and then closed in the late 90's. Became a haunted house for Halloween, now closed. Lights have also been reported flickering.- December Update: The house is still there, but they are building a bunch of office buildings all around it. The submitter to the update is not sure about the maids house next store, you cant see it from the road. They would no longer advise going to the house now because it looks to be in bas shape, some work being done to it. Also with all the construction going on it may not be safe.
