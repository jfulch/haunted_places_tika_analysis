country: United States
description: it is rumored that a little girl was playing in the top of a barn and fell all the way down. An hour later she died from blood loss. it was in the broken down old barn in the middle of Oliver Springs. Anyone who has ever been in it has heard strange noises, and sounds like fingernails scratching in the very back of the barn. As soon as you walk into the barn it feels like someone is staring at you. And in the very back you can see what seem to be blood red eyes staring straight at you.
