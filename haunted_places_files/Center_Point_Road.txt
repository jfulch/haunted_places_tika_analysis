description: Center Point Road is a road a little past the outskirt's of town. On foggy nights you can see a truck, but after a little while, it disappears. You can see it's headlights and it even looks solid. Also, you can feel like there's something in the backseat, staring at the back of your head. There's a bunch of old, abandoned houses dotting the sides of the road. Some of those could be haunted.
