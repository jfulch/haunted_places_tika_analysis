description: The more known name of the road is Gravity Hill. The story goes...there used to be railroad tracks at the bottom of the road and there was a school bus filled with children and their bus stalled on the railroad tracks and all the kids died. If you go to this road and put power on your bumper and you put your car in neutral the kids push you back UP THE HILL. After stopping at the top you can get out of your car and see the handprints of little kids on your bumper.
