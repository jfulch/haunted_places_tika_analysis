description: If you are parked at the top of the hill and flash your lights three times you will see a motorcycle come toward you. Legend has it a guy and a girl were not allowed to see each other so the girl would sneak out at night and flash a light three times. To the her boyfriend waiting at the top of the road. But one night she flashed the lights and he started toward her house, but wrecked on the way and died. So now when you flash you lights he thinks that it is his girlfriend and he starts to come down the road.
