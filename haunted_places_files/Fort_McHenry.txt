description: The Fort was used throughout history in guarding Baltimore Maryland. Many stories of ghosts and ghostly activity include: a shadowy figure marching along the parapets, an evil spirit in the hallway leading to the bathrooms, floating or moving furniture, tour guides during the Ghost Tour being surrounded in unearthly light, and voices heard by employees after the Fort has been closed to visitors. The stories are well known by local residents and many people who worked at the Fort or visited it can attest to these occurrences.
