description: The present barn is a replacement, the original one having burnt down during a punk rock show in the early 1990s. Police have responded to many calls from nearby residents claiming to hear a loud party going on at the site, some even seeing cars parked all around the barn. Every time the police arrive, though, the barn is empty and silent.
