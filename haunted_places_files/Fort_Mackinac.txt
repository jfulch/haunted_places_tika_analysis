description: has its own ghosts. The children of the post commander are supposed to haunt the officers hill quarters. The hospitals near and in the fort are undoubtedly haunted and are surrounded by an air of sickness to this day. A skeleton was found in the "Black Hole" of the guardhouse and now people get the usual chills along their spines in the reconstructed guardhouse. There is supposedly a phantom piper that walks on the stonework above the North Sally Port. He is only sighted on misty mornings and his music can be heard faintly.
