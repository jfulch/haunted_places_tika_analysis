description: (near Joe pool lake) - this place has a sign that says - 'posted - no trespassing' - and a man does own this land, and lives very deep into the graveyard, but he probably wont see you, regardless.. be careful... this graveyard is said to be a burial ground for dead soldiers from the civil war.. if you go there late at night/early morning (from midnight to about 3 am) you will see a red light down the road into the darkness, when you get closer to it.. it goes away... when you go in the graveyard (after jumping the fence) you hear voices.. random wind gusts.. cold spots.. and gunshots, and screaming men... and it has been reported that a couple of teenagers who went to the graveyard came back to the car, to find all the doors unlocked.. when they made sure it was locked before they went inside.. and also, there was a small child's handprint inside the car which no human hand could reach (it was near the bottom of the windshield, meeting the dash board).. and when you leave the graveyard, if you look back.. you will see flashing lights, as if a gun is emitting a light... some have also reported strange things happening in the month visiting this haunted graveyard.
