description: There is an old cemetery on Wehr Road that is said to be haunted. Many people have driven down it at night, as it is very popular to younger kids. Once you approach the cemetery, a man, dressed in old dirty clothes will chase you away. He is said to be the old caretaker of the cemetery who was killed by a maniac with a hatchet. He now carries the hatchet and, on some nights, if you drive by you can hear the hatchet hitting a metal door on the side of the mausoleum. There are several hatchet marks on this door.
