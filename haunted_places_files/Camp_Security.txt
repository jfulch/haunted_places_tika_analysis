description: This was a prison camp during the Revolutionary war, here British soldiers were kept. There is a trail that goes back into the woods, when walking back there you get an eerie feeling. Accounts have said that ghost have been spotted along this trail at night. Walking through this place you can still find bullet shells laying around. part of the old camp is private property now, the other part is a regular recreational park.March 2008 Update â€“ up until the 1870s muskets did not use brass shells, but paper cartridges with black powder or just black powder with a ball. So brass shells would have nothing to do with the Revolutionary War.
