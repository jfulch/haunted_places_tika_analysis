description: In 1999, Bill Stien, a taxi driver employed by Everett Yellow Cab Co., had a heart attack in the parking lot at Mallard Cove Apartments ( Airport Road and Admiralty Way). Now he haunts the (g) building. He sometimes sneaks into people's apartments, picks up the phone and writes down a real address: In the morning residents find his mysterious notes by the phone, and find the door open. People who have seen Bill describe his ghost as a man in his late 40's and wearing a Mariner b-ball cap, sweats, and a beer in his right hand.
