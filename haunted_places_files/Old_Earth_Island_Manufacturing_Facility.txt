description: (now empty) - This spot is a small industrial business strip on Alabama Ave. across from the large self storage building and behind the wheel and tire and dirt bike gear shop. In the warehouse late at night you could hear the ghost of a woman screaming as it passed you from the back to the front. Reports of seeing the apparition and greeting them as a person and realizing no one was there have happened. One account was a repairman working on the water heating system he was at work after hours and his tool chest was on his left side, as he was working the tool chest was slammed down on his right side hard enough to startle him and send him running out of the building. Additionally, the ghost was said to live in the attic area of the walk in refrigerator. the walk-ins ceiling was later removed to increase space and a storage area was walled off above th e kitchen. Every day before work started, the door to the room would be open even if it was locked the night before Take Caution. The building is locked and it is doubtful that the present occupants will allow access.
