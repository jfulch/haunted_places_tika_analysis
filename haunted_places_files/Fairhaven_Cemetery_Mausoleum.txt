description: Lower Level - In the lower level, there is a wall of the crypts of children. Occasionally the faint sound of a child crying pierces the silence of the hallway down by this wall. UPDATE: "baby wall" no longer exists. Apparently the crypts have been moved (or disbursed), and a closed-circuit surveillance camera has been installed over the spot.
