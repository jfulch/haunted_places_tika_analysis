description: There is a grave where in the way back that is not in the cemetery and in the trees and it was said to be moved back there from a ghost, because everything was moved even the body and there were no marks of some one who dug in the ground, or grass took off ground. If you go there in the night you can see the guy digging a hole with a glowing green shovel. He was said to work as a gravedigger in 1902 but then fell in the grave and broke his neck and died instantly.
