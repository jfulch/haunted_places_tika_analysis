description: At night at midnight shift footsteps from a mentally unstable lady that had died before are seen coming down the hall and the familiar scuffling of her slippers can be heard. Then she goes to the door that is across the room where she was at and slams the door as she always did when she heard the lady screaming in the room. The people in the room are unable to get up and do so. The nurse aides would go to the room and the patient in the room would be staring wide eyed at the door. - March 2007 Update: recently torn down
