description: -BACK CAMPUS-...On Halloween night in 1857 there were 2 students who were walking in the back of campus. There is a big pipe line that goes over the creek. Rumor has it the 2 students were trying to cross the creek on the pipe line and fell off into the creek which is only about 2 foot deep. To this day on Halloween night if you go there you can see fingernail scratches on the pipe where they slipped off and hear screaming from down below.
