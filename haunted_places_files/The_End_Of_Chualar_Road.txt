description: Many times a night when you drive home you can see a woman walking on the side of the road. When you pass her she disappears. One report states, “One time I was at the end of my road (which is at the End of Chualr road) I was riding my motorcycle and I was masterly thrown off by something. When I hit the ground I passed out and when I woke up I saw a black hair woman above me staring at me. I blinked and she was gone. I am almost positive it was the lady on the side of the road.”
