city: Quinault
country: United States
description: Sometime in the early 1900's there was a fire here that destroyed a couple of buildings. There was only one fatality, a cleaning woman caught in the attic. After the rebuild, most of the original attic was saved and restored. You can still feel her when you go up there (it's a small conference room now) and in the kitchen, she throws glasses and silverware where nobody was there before. Call them, they'll tell you the story there.
