description: The resturant employees have claimed of seeing orbs of light and feeling cold spots, as well as the lights and ovens turning on and off in many different occasions. Some of the people who have eaten there say they have felt as if someone was standing behind them whispering, when nobody was there. There have been stories of a young teenage boy having been shot and killed in front of the resturant, in the 1980's sometime. It is said that it is his angry and depressed spirt that plagues this location with the paranormal. - August, 2005 Update: Beef Villa (half Fact) The original Beef Villa that was involved in a murder in the 1980s has been torn down. Another Beef Villa has been built in its place that is much bigger so that it can handle more customers. The new building is further back in the lot than the old one. Where the old one existed is now parking. No activity has been reported seen since the new building was up.- January 2006 Update: Well known urban legend started by students at the local High School across the street in order to scare the freshmen. What was uncovered was no death had occurred, there was a gang shooting in the 1980s the victim survived. We checked everything including police reports to verify this. There is an awkward magnetic field in the area which has explained the orbs as the buildings around the Beef Villa and even the Beef Villa were torn down and rebuilt and the road it is on is under construction once a year as it as a main road that attaches to the local highway.WARNING:If there is anyone that is planning on doing anything in any of those locations they must be sure that they have permission first else they will be arrested.
