description: Once you park in the middle of two trees facing the cemetery just like the midnight jogger turn your lights on high beam. Once we waited a while two of our friends decided to roam around the cemetery for fun one of them dared the other to walk forward and touch three that was a short distance away well she did and that is when we saw something black with it's arms crossed and it's head lying down like it is laying in a casket, at the very tip of the tree.
