description: Some guests have died from natural causes while riding the ride and two maintenance guys have been crushed by the cars while working on the hydraulics. On the third floor at the entrance there are large mirrors where a small hand print appears about 7 ft up especially when that floor isn't being used. won't be cleaned off. also on the third floor when it's closed you hear the song one of the maintenance guys liked to whistle and the sound moves up and down the halls. on the second floor when cleaning cars at the end of the day the cars will close on the employee with no one at the controls and you hear a small girl giggle. also some heavy doors open on their own when the ride isn't turned on. also shadows are seen in the employee hallway up to the third floor followed by a feeling of foreboding.
