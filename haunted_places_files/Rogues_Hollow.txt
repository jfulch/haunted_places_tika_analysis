description: Cry Baby Bridge - Same Bridge as above/different story - There is a little bridge near a vacant house called Cry Baby Bridge. Legend states that in the early 1900's, there was a supposed witch that was impregnated by a married man. The towns' people decided to take the baby away from her, and she would have none of this. Rather than her child be taken, the woman threw it off the bridge. People claim that you can sometimes hear the baby crying in the middle of the night while standing on the bridge.
