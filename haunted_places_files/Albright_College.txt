description: Selwyn Hall - The third floor of Selwyn Hall, an ex-sorority house (but now it serves as a variety of things-health clinic, admissions, facilities, etc.), is said to be home to the ghost of a girl who committed suicide there. The details of the exact circumstances surrounding her death aren't very well known, as the involved sororities keep it as hushed as possible. But the rumor of the motivation behind the suicide was the girl being rejected from the sororities and therefore taking her life.
