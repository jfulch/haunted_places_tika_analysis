country: United States
description: it used to be called leigon park, and it was a swimming hole. There is also a cemetery of the first settler farmstead Runyons' family. You can hear people talking in the forest in the broad daylight, and it is not voices you would hear in every day tone. if you climb a hill, you will see where the old flag pole was, plus the old well. Some of the trails are treacherous so wear hiking shoes. it has since been renovated, and the old buildings torn down. it is very creepy at night, to the point that you can still hear the "witch" calling for her followers. Sometimes you hear a language you cannot even describe. if you must go, go in a group.
