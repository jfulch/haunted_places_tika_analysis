description: In the mid 70's a man hung himself from one of the trees near the bend. On foggy nights you can see a shadow walking and hear moaning. - June 2008 Update: they have changed Carpenter Road. It doesn't bend anymore, they have turned the bend into a 3-way intersection leading into an apartment complex or condominiums or something. The have also built a giant middle school in one of the fields near carpenter road, so you may not actually be able to see hanged man anymore.
