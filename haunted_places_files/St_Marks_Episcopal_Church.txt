description: the ghost of a man killed during the construction of the bell tower haunts the tower. - February 2007 Correction: There is no report of anyone dying during construction. The story was kept up for fun especially at Halloween when the previous Rector would hold a haunted house complete with a construction worker corpse in a coffin! There is also a tale of the tower being boarded off because of a spirit of a former Rector haunting it. However, the tower is boarded off because it is unsafe, the stairs weak and the floors unstable. St. Mark's is a beautiful church filled with love, light and everything good. Anyone wanting to visit the church should, the congregation will welcome you with open arms.
