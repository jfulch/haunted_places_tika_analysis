description: An old man dressed in a black suit with a brown leather hat holding a leather pouch can be seen on some nights just standing in the graveyard. We lived right next door to the graveyard and on more than one occasion observed him standing in the same spot just staring straight ahead. One rainy dark night we watched him as he slowly walked away and down the street, we decided to follow him, got in our car and drove around the corner where he had just went a moment before; he was no where in sight.
