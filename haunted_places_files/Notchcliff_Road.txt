description: Located about a mile and a half from the Loch Raven Reservoir, Notchcliff road is a long and winding dark road. The road, due to it's sharp turns and constant hills, has been the site of many accidents. One such accident stands out though. Around 11:30 p.m. coming in from the front way, double yellow lines slowly disappear and around the next turn, off in the distance you can see headlights and a mangled car. As you drive closer it slowly disappears and there is a tree with red "paint", busted up from the car.
