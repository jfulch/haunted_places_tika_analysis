description: Cemetery - There has been reported sightings of a female figure wearing a lace outfit walking down the side street of the cemetery. No one is quite sure who the spirit is, or what she wants, but if you do see her, it will be late at night. Many people have stopped thinking it is a real woman who may need help, but when you stop, all you hear is crying off in the distance, and they say that you can see her lying over a tombstone, where she is reportedly crying!
