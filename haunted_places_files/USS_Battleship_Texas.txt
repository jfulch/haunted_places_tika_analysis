description: A sailor named "Red" is occasionally seen by visitors and staff appear wearing a WW2 era Navy uniform. He would sometimes acknowledge your presence and then vanish usually into a wall or a closed door. Some say Red is the ghost of the Texas' only seaman killed in WW2. The organization that now operates the Battleship Texas now offers a “stay the night” program.
