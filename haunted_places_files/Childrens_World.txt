description: A young lady that worked at this daycare not to long ago says that it was after 11pm and she was finishing paper work so she could go home. When she went out to the parking lot, there was a man standing in the playground walking towards her. She loaded her car and every time she turned around, the man was closer to her. She got into her car and locked the doors and when she turned around, the man was gone, and nowhere to be found. It is also said that if you are in the building by yourself late at night, you will hear whispers and strange noises.
