city: Rock Creek (Bullhead)
country: United States
description: Witnesses report hearing an old record player, foot steps and doors opening when the building is empty. teacher's grading papers late at night will also hear voices and paper, desk, and chairs moving around. One occasion the head cook opened early to cook breakfast and heard voices coming toward her but no one was there. Another occasion people will see a man and woman peaking out of the window late at night when they pass by the school. Along time ago there was a flood in Rock Creek that took out a graveyard, the water covered the entire village that all the coffins were floating around and they had to evacuate to the hills, horseback riders roped the coffins to bring to shore. A lot of the coffins were opened and no bodies were missing. A lot of the bodies were sunk into the sand. So it is to believe that the whole village is haunted.Â  There is to believe that a tall man dressed in black roams the village late at night. A lot of residences of this small village have seen him. There has been a report of a Skelton seen hanging in a tree on Booth Road.
