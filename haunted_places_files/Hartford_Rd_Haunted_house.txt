description: Now this haunting is not something you can see off the main road. You must turn onto a dirt rd. You then park your car, get out and make sure you have a flash light. You enter an abandon house, its all tore up, writing on the walls, help me all over, children toys and clothes all over. While in the house you will hear a bouncing of a basketball, screaming, and talking that can not be made out, and door knobs turning behind you. This is not something you do alone. - September 2004 update: The house has been torn down.
