description: A young woman who was beheaded on a road while riding in her wagon in the 1800s still haunts the area. The family, who owns a hunting camp next to the lane where she was killed, has experienced unexplained events. Green lights that have been linked to spiritual hauntings, seeing young children play in period clothes and disappearing, and being slapped in the middle of sleeping have all occurred without a single explanation.
