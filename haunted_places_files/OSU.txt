description: Sackett Hall - In one of the rooms is the sight of numerous disturbances including fire starting and things be thrown around the room. It is said that a girl was killed in that room. Her name was Brandy and she lived in room 121. She was known to be very loose particularly since it was the 1950's and one night she was killed by accident by a drunken frat boy. She still roams B-long, her physical body having been turned to dust ages ago all that remains is her angry spirit which is seen at times to be a swirling cloud, twisting and turning in constant eternal anguish for a unpunished crime...very few have seen her.
