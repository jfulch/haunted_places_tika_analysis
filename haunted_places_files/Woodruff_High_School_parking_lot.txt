description: An outdoor swimming pool was once located at the site. Sometime after it was built, some kids climbed the fence for a midnight swim. A teenage boy drowned, almost pulling his girlfriend down with him. Teenage girls who drive across the spot sometime feel a hand at their ankles, pulling their foot hard onto the gas pedal.
