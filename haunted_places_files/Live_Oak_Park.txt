description: In the park there is a couple of large boulders that were used by Indians to grind acorns. The acorns were then used to make a sort of bread. The many years of grinding made indentations into the rocks. The Police department has over 2 dozen reports of an Indian girl Grinding acorns on these rocks. The reports all very in time of day but the description of the little girl is always similar.
