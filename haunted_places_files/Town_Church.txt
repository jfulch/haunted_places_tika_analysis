description: In the ward house the chapel is upstairs. It has been reported that after hearing the organ playing, a man ran upstairs to see who it was because he should have been the only one in the building. He could not see a body, but organ was being played right in front of his eyes, keys and floor pedals. Soon the playing stopped and he saw a silhouette of a old woman drifting away from the organ.
