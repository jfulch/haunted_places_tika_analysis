description: Former employees described clearly hearing footsteps, regularly occurring, walking upstairs when nobody was up there. In what was formerly a house, now a retail store, employees describe having the feeling of being watched, and often catching a glimpse of a figure in a hanging wall mirror. Also, the bells on the door chime on their own when no breeze or person is in the room. - May 2008 Update - The building where Buttons and Things was is now gone. It was demolished to make way for more retail progress in Freeport.
