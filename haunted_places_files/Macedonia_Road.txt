description: When you go under a train bridge in a very sharp turn. It is very dark there & gives off a very weird vibe. Many people have died in that turn because you cannot see the turn until you are in it. A ghost is seen there in the road, which looks like a thin strip of fog, but there is no other fog anywhere in the area.
