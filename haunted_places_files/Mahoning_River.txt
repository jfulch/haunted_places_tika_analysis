description: The Underground Railroad" - All too many homes in the area that still stand from that time all have secret passages, hidden doors and any trick the Railroaders could think to build. One in specific of these devices was a tunnel that led right beneath the Mahoning River itself not but two hundred yards from the Courthouse, of which is still standing in it's own eloquence. this tunnel was of about the length of a football field and is not visible form but five feet from either entrance, and now has been fortified off for danger of collapse. Apparently that is what brought about such as is a haunting. during time of escaping slaves, the tunnel had once collapsed. the river only being one third as wide as the tunnel was long still waved threat. a collapse toward an end trapped a group of slaves who moans and screams could be heard for days. The screams can still be heard on cool autumn days.
