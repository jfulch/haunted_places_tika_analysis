description: The ghost of a man who died in the 1840's is seen here. He is seen often as a shadowy figure in period clothing in the cemetery, the adjacent woods and the fields across the street. The apparition is known as Benjamin Miles, a local settler who is buried there in an unmarked grave. It is said that this is a particularly angry and dangerous spirit. His presence is accompanied by a chill in the air and the call of an owl. The sound of that owl is said to be a warning that Benjamin Miles is nearby. All of these phenomena are almost always seen at night usually in the fall and winter seasons
