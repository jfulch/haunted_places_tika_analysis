description: This theatre is thought to be haunted. Actors and custodians have all experienced such phenomenon as doors closing behind them and lighting fixtures falling to the ground near the stage and throughout the rest of the building. In one promotional picture from a few years ago, the distinct image of the founder, T.J. Ramsdell, appears to be floating in the air near the balcony seats.
