description: A long time ago a girl name Rose was driving along when here car stalled out going up a hill. The car rolled back to the bottom of the hill. After trying to restart the car she got out to look under the hood. That was when she was grabbed by a man and murdered by her car. Now people say that if you go to where she was killed you should dust the trunk of your car with flour and place a rose on the trunk. Then when you drive up the hill and check the trunk there will be handprints on the trunk and the rose will be gone. They say that her ghost helps every car get up the hill.
