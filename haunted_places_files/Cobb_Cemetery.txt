description: On a normal basis, this cemetery is haunted by a ghost that walks among the grave at about 1:24 A.M. AS the story goes this ghost is a man late 80's ; retired officer looking for his wife. He appears mostly in Feb. - January 2007 additional information: The road is between a gas station on highway 90 and a hairdressing place. Keep going past the church, a ways. This road is mostly paved. It's on the left hand side on a dirt road - itâ€™s very narrow (ie, you can't turn around in it till your in the cemetery) KKK apparitions, ghosts of the lynched and a wondering man. There seem to be a lot of white flashes, like a sheet running and then it's gone.
