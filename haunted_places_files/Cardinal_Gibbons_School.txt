description: The school used to be St. Mary's industrial school what housed the infamous Babe Ruth as a small child. Some teachers say that his ghost haunts the school from time to time. One specific ghost story happened when the Atheletic Director was in the basement of the gym late at night. He heard a ball bouncing and when he went upstairs all the lights were on. No one could have gotten into the gym and the lights would have taken at least 10 minutes to warm up. No body to this day can explain it.
