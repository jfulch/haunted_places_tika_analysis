description: About ten years ago there was a man who would visit the bar at Seville Quarter frequently. He would visit so much, that he was offered a bartending job there. He worked there for a while and everyone loved him. He died in the bar one night (not exactly sure how) but people have reportedly seen his ghost in the bar area
