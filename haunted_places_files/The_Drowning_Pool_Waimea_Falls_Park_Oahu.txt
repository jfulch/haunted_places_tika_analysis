description: There is an old Hawaiian legend surrounding this location. It is said that there is an akua (ah-coo-wah), or god in the pond at the bottom of the falls. On occasion it requires a human sacrifice and takes a "victim", drowns them, and keeps them underwater for a few days. the body is never found before the "ceremony" is done. Then about 3 days later, the body is found floating on top of the water.
