description: rail road tracks - a old house that has been there for years, its falling apart and the windows are broke, some say a old man killed himself in there, at night you can see him on the door step, some have seen him on the rail road tracks right next to blue springs, the legend is he overdosed on pills if you go in the building you can feel a unhappy spirit there and you feel cold lonely and not wanted there.
