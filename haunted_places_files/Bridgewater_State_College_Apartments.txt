description: In 9C of the student apartments on campus, stamping, knocking and smells arise. At night on the lower level outside of the emergency exit there is a knocking on the door that once it is opened there is no one there. In the living room of this same apartment a smell of decay and rot suddenly appears, enough to make you sick, and then disappears. The stamping emerges only in the middle of the night in the hall, but once the door is opened no one is there.
