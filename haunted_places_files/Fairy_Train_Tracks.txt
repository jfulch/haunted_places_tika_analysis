city: Steilacoom
country: United States
description: Steilacoom - is notorious for its ghost encounters and has established a well-known history for all of those who live in the surrounding areas of the town. Located on the train tracks directly in front of the fairy pier you can sometimes hear a faint ghostly sound of a phantom train whistle followed by a distinct scream from a person supposedly to have been struck by a train. The fairy pier is said to have strange occurrences itself. Late at night, the ghostly figure of a young child can be seen from a distance playing along the pier. While walking towards it however, it slowly maturates into a much older and feebler looking figure until it slowly fades away.
