description: East of Ada, on the Chickasaw Nation land named Kullihoma, one can see bouncing balls of bright lights floating around. These balls of light are actually little people. These little people are helpers, about two or three feet tall and would usually be seen by young Indian children if they were called to help these little fellows. They never die even when the children grow old---they simply seek out another person to train to doctor or just be obnoxious to anyone around!
