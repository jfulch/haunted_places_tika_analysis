description: There was a girl, named Victoria, who had a lead role in a musical, but in the night of the opening performance she died in a car accident. She is said to haunt the costume room in the attic, also known as "heaven", at Aquinas. Every once and a while, while the tech crew are up there a door may slam or a window and there's footsteps when no one else is up there.
