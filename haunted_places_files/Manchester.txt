description: Graveyard - A town once buried by Lake Guntersville, it has only left its mark with a Civil War era graveyard. This was a place where s√©ances were once popular. Day or night there is a constant fog that covers the ground that surrounds the gravestones. Not an easy place to find unless you live in the area, but nonetheless SCARY!!!!!
