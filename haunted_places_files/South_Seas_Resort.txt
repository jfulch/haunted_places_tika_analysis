Also on the North end of the resort, the King's Crown restaurant is haunted by the former manager who died on premises. Plays the piano after hours, employees will hear the piano after closing and come in to find nobody there. If the silverware is not rolled right, employees will leave the room for a moment and come back to find the bucket dumped out. He had a sense of humor... he will arrange all the silverware on the tables so they form a zig-zag pattern down the rows of tables.
