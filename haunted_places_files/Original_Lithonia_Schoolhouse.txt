city: Lithonia
country: United States
description: Located on Stephenson Road, across from a rock quarry, is the original Lithonia schoolhouse, built circa 1865. It has been converted to a private residence, but the ghosts of children are frequently seen. Many of the former pupils are buried in an old church cemetery located about 200 yards away. 8-year-old Elizabeth has been seen by several individuals (including psychic Shirley Janey) flaunting her golden-brown curls. Several people have also seen the ghost of a teenage boy walking around the entry hall, as well as a mysterious hooded figure. The rustling sounds of a schoolmarm's heavily starched dresses are frequently heard as well.
