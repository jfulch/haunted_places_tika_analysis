description: This is the cemetery where General Sam Houston is buried, and also where the statue college kids call black Jesus is located. It's a bronze statue on the far north edge of the cemetery, kind of in the middle. It is in a gorgeous spot with palms and it is recessed into the woods a bit, with benches and such. All the graves in the cemetery are laid out with the feet facing East, this families graves are the only ones where the feet face west. A family erected the statue when there 5 year old son died and the bronze soon weathered to a black color that could not be cleaned. The Jesus is a classic pose with the hands out stretched and palms up, except sometime when you go out at night the hands are turned down!
