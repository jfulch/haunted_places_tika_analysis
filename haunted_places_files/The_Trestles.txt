description: There was supposed to have been a little boy who lived in the house next to the creek under the trestles. He went out one day to watch a train go by from the top of the hill and fell onto the tracks, he was then run over. If you drive under the trestles right at dusk, you can see his blue shirt blowing in the wind stuck in the middle of the tracks, and him waving to you from the tracks.
