city: Blackwell
country: United States
description: Rumor goes that an old farmhouse southeast of Blackwell was where the family Hollopeter used to live. There used to be an old iron bridge there with the wooden floor that Mr. Hollopeter's daughter hung herself on. It is said that you can sometimes see the rope from which she hung herself still hanging on the bridge. Apparently, they left the rope hanging there for a long time after the suicide. (the bridge is right next to the farmhouse) It is also said that if you drive be the house at night, and you look up into the top of the barn, you'll see the grandmother sitting in her rocking chair feeding the chickens on the ground. Also, Mr. Hollopeter is said to have appeared on his white horse down in the bottom of the river, which is very shallow, when you honk your horn and flash your lights while sitting on the bridge. This area floods very badly, so the old bridge is no longer there, it was finally washed away about 3 yrs or so ago.
