description: It is said that in the fall of the year - near Halloween - that deep in the woods to the east of Pug Road, there will be a faint glow. And if one listens carefully, you can still hear the screams echoing down through the centuries. Before the settlement of Saint Clair County, there had been a French fur trader and his family who'd set up a trading post just off the "big river". He chose this location because of the canoe traffic on the river. They did well in their venture until one falls in the early 1700's. While the trapper trader was up north, Indians attacked the trading post, burning it to the ground, along with the trapper's wife and children. It has to be a quiet night, preferably with moon, and if you watch and listen closely.
