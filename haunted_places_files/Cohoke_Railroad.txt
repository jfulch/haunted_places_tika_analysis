city: West Point/King William
country: United States
description: Near the small crossroads town of Cohoke in King William, a ghost train appears to visitors more times than it doesn't. Looking down the tracks towards the west, a light will come like a train, but with no noise. It will get closer and closer and then just disappear. Also occasionally this light will be preceded by the apparition of a confederate soldier holding a lantern.
