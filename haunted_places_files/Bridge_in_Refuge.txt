description: There's this bridge in a place called Refuge. Itâ€™s a small, one-lane bridge in the middle of nowhere. If you go there at night, you can hear strange sounds and see balls of light. Some people have said that when you get out of your car, you can hear and feel someone walking right next to you and feel a menacing presence. Lots of people have seen fog chasing them and there's one area that no trees grow and everything looks dead. People have reported that their cars will start rocking, as well as being chased by an unknown entity. You can also feel an evil presence on some nights.
