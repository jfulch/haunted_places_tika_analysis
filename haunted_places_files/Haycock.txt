description: Top Rock Trail Road - Pa Rt.313 north (south from Quakertown, north from Doyelstown) turn right onto Rt.563 follow for a few miles then turn left onto Top Rock Trail. This turn is easy to miss! The road winds up this twisting hill through the countryside. Up on about the second bend, a pull off is on the side of the road that leads to a trail into the woods (some people was logging up in here). Following the trail up to the top of the hill reveals an amazing rock formation that has been used by Indians and supposedly a few cults that centered around animal torture. The Indian presence is documented and a historical fact, the cults are just here say. A feeling of disorientation is felt. At night "glowing" eyes/orbs of light can be seen in the woods. Also, you can hear the whelping of animals within the woods. There is definitely something here, and it will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. There is a gigantic "table top" rock that is to the left of the main formation, underneath of this is a few small crawl through that give an overwhelming feeling of despair.
