description: The Erie cemetery is said to be haunted. There are a few locations that are definitely eerie. The first one is a mausoleum. It's blackened, like it was burned. There's no name on it, but you can tell that there used to be one. It also has a lot of vampire like designs on it. The other area is called the Witches Circle. It is a group of tombstones that are in the shape of a circle. Some of them are burnt black. Legend has it that Satan came to get his loyal followers. The burns are supposed to be from the fires of Hell. It has been tried repeatedly to get the scorch marks off of the tombstones, but it doesn't ever come off. I've inspected these stones myself and tried to read what they said on them. One had some pretty weird stuff on it. You get chills and hear walking behind you while at this cemetery. When you turn around, though, no one is there. Witnesses have seen a big black dog there and when they looked again, it wasn't there.
