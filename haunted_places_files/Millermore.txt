description: A two story Greek revival home completed in 1861, is currently the center piece of Old City Park Museum. Over the last 30 years there have been continual stories of a haunting in the house. Many unrelated individuals (museum guests, volunteers, and staff) have sensed the presence of a female spirit in the house. The activity seems to center around the former nursery and master bedroom on the second floor.
