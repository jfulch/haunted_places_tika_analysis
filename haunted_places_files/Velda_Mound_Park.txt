description: Old Indian Village. Sometimes at night, you can see visions of Indianâ€™s keeping warm by a fire, but in a split second, they're gone. There is sometimes said that there is a white wolf that glows that can be seen there, and neighbors often say that they can hear it howling throughout the night.
