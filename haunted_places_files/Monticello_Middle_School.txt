description: Legend has it that while this school was being built, a young girl died. She took cookies to the workers often, but was victim to a terrible fate one day when she fell in an area of freshly poured cement. Her ghost has been seen wandering the halls of the school at night, humming a tune. The girlâ€™s footsteps have been heard as well.
