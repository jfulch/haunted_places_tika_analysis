description: This is the first Catholic church built in Rhode Island.  The building of it was met with resistance by the local Protestants who were the majority at the time.  The builder and his wife Mary completed the church anyway despite warnings that if the ground was broken for the church, the person who dug the first shovel of earth would lie beneath it.  That unfortunate person was Mary.  It is her spirit who supposedly haunts the church.  Lights have been turned on and off, candles have inexplicably gone out and items have been moved from various areas of the church.  She seems to be a benevolent spirit and the priests at the church accept her as part of the parish.
