description: The ghost of the head nurse can be seen pacing on the front porch. If you sit on the front steps, she will come out and talk to you and then ask you to leave. There is no power going into the house, but a white light can be seen thru the front window and a red light thru the back porch window (these windows are not aligned, so it is not the same light).
