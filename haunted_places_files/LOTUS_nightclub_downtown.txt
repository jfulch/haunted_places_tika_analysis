description: Reports of something VERY creepy in the basement - has scared employees so badly, they refuse to talk about it. a bartender, alone after closing had finished cleaning the bar-i.e. no glasses were left out, etc. and went downstairs-to the creepy basement?-and heard a CO2 canister activate.  A very distinct sound and not made when not in use-that is to say there is no pressure release on CO2 cylinders.  Upon coming back upstairs the bartender found an upside-down shot glass on the bar.
