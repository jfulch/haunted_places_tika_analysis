description: on an old country road just outside of the university the lights of a ghost can be summoned by flashing your car lights 3 times. Forbidden lovers once used this sign when they would meet at night. But one night the guy coming on his motorcycle died. You can see red lights, a concentrated white light (like the light of a motorcycle), and then many lights (like an ambulance.
