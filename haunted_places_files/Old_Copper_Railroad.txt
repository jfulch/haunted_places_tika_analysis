description: This was the railroad from Cordova to the Kennicott copper mine. It was closed and covered with dirt. It is now used as a road to access the back areas along the Copper River. There have been sightings of gravestones along the dirt road in the woods, but upon second investigation, they would be gone. There was government housing being built in Chitna from 1997-98. It was closed down for a while because the workers would hear voices and children laughing. Also, tools would be misplaced right after workers would put them down. Sometimes at night in back woods along the dirt road, you can hear voices and children laughing as well. - March 2007 Correction/Additional Information: The correct spelling of the town is 'Chitina' although old publishing's have used the 'Chitna' spelling. The railroad was located by the town of Chitina and continued on for approximately 60 more miles t o Kennicott.
