description: Lumber Baron Inn - June 2005 Correction: previously listed in Boulder- In the 1970's this house was converted into apartments. A young run away girl, 17 years old, lived in one apartment. She was raped and murdered one night. A friend of hers stumbled upon the murder and was also killed. The house is now a bed and breakfast. There have been several haunting incidences, including a sighting of a girl in a flapper dress. Footsteps have been heard and seen on the squeaky steps. www.lumberbaron.com
