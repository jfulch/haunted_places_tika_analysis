description: St. Clair Hall - January 2007 Correction Formerly listed as Miller Hall - when the college was founded in the mid 1800's as a girlâ€™s Christian school Miller was the main building and the students' dorm was in the attic. There was a fire in the dorm room and supposedly one of the girls died in her bed. The attic is now off limits to students behind a black steel door always kept locked and is used for storage. Janitorial staff and security have reported hearing a sound like a mewing cat or footsteps from the room, but never can find the source of the noises.
