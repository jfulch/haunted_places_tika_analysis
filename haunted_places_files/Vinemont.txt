description: Cry Baby Hollow Off Highway 31 North in Cullman County - It is said that when Cullman was being settled, a family in a wagon was crossing the small wooden bridge. A wheel broke off and the wagon turned over, throwing a small baby into the creek, killing it. Since that time, you can hear a baby crying. Also, if you put a candy bar on the bridge, leave and then come back, there will be a bite taken out of it.
