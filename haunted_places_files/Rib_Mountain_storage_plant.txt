description: One foggy night in the late evening, a couple of kids reported seeing a lady with a knife in her chest. They went closer to see what was making a loud ruckus in the second story of an abandon storage building. They climbed to the second floor and to their astonishment they found blood on the walls and a lady and her kid in the bath tub soaked in a tub of blood. knives were protruding threw various body parts and the kids started to twitch uncontrollably. They looked back after trying to leave and everything was gone. So now every night at about 12:00 on the dot you can see the boys twitching profusely and the decomposed mother and her child in a bath tub of blood. The building has been torn down but you can still see them for a brief second or two or three at exactly 12:00.
