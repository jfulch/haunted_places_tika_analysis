description: This building was once a whorehouse. In the mid 19th century a wealthy man was having an affair with one of the women in the house. His eldest son was so upset with the way people were talking about his family and with the way his mother was being treated that he followed his father to the Levee House one night. He killed both his father and his father's lover. To this day very early in the morning on certain days the man can be seen entering the back door to the building.
