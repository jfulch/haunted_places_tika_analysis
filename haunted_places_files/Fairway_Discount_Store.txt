description: It used to be a butcher shop. When no one else is in the store, employees claim stuff has flown off the shelves and they have had felt someone breathing on the back of they're neck when they're stocking shelves. They have even seen people walking around, and then when they go to see if they need help...they are gone. No one goes in the basement, at least not alone anyway. It has strange "vibes" and its just creepy.
