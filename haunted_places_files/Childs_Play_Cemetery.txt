description: go wash your vehicle to great cleanliness on the bottoms and windows. Go down this gravel road and stop and check your car. Make note of any prints or anything on your car. Then go in to the cemetery stop and sit for about five minutes. You will probably hear a loud thud on your car. Thats when you leave. When you get to the next town, grab a flashlight or whatnot and look at your car. You will have a large handprint on your back glass, and lots of little handprints on your car body.
