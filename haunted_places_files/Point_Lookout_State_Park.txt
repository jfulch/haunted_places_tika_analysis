description: If you go late at night and are driving out of the park, once you pass Ft. Lincoln you can feel a presence start to follow you. Sometimes the impression is so strong, you can expect to see a young man in Confederate Grays in the back seat. He stays until you pass the Confederate Cemetery, and then vanishes.
