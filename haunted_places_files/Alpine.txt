description: Sul Ross State University - The story is of a young woman who killed herself in the Fletcher resident hall. To this day a girl can be seen walking around late at night in a skimpy nightgown. Also, things end up missing even if the doors had been locked all day. People report seeing strange apparitions at the foot of the bed. Whenever there is a mention of the "Fletcher Ghost", a door slams, there is a loud bang, someone screams, or some other jolting noise. This is first and second hand experience when my best friend lived in that dorm.
