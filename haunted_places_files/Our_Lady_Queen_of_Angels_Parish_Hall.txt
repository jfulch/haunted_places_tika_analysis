description: Story goes, several decades ago the captain of the school's basketball team took his cheerleader girlfriend up to one of the rooms in the back of the upstairs. He said he wanted to give her something, so she agreed to go with him. When they got up there, he pulled out a knife and stabbed her because he said he saw her cheating on him. When you go up there now, when you `pen the doors, they shut. And when they are shut, they open. You can hear the pipes clanking and sometimes you can see the figure of an older woman walk through the halls. This upstairs used to be a school, but is now used for the hall and storage.
