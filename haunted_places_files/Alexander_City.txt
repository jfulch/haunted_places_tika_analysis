description: Sturdivant Mansion - This is an old mansion in which you can see people standing in the upper windows, as well as lights at a distance, even though there are no floors or roof in the place. It was once a place where people would get off the train and stay for the night. That is, until one night someone got off and killed every occupant of the house.
