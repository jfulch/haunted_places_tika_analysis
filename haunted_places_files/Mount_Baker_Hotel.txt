description: Make it known that if you are going to this hotel, and you go upstairs be prepared, you will see a little girl about 4, with red hair and blue jean shorts on, with a pink shirt on! She might try to push you down the stairs (Do Not Be Alarmed!) but it does not work. All you can feel is a sort of tingle go through your body. You can hear a little girls voice saying "The bad womanâ€™s gonna hurt me!" Also you might hear "Turn around, the bad woman will hurt you!" People say that her mother used to beat her to death.
