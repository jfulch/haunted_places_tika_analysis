description: About 50 years ago when this building was being built, one of the workers who was building the stairs that go up to the ambulance service, beside the police department fell, crashing to his death. The other workers were afraid that they would be blamed for his death, so they buried him under the stairs where his remains are still said to be. At night you can hear things coming from the stairs, there are cold spots and sometimes when watching movies certain scenes are fast forwarded.
