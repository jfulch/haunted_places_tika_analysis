description: In Mytrle Hill Cemetery there is a giant granite ball that is a gravestone. No matter how cold it is outside the ball is warm to the touch. The story as it goes is that a witch is buried under the gravestone. And if you go there late at night and touch the ball and its warm the witch is in her grave and if its cold she is out searching for souls. There are supposedly 5 of these across the state of Ohio that when they are connected they form a pentagram.
