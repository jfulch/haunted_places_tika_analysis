description: Several of the buildings built in the early part of the 1900's have been abandoned.  These are the buildings that housed the violently insane for many decades.  These patients lived a miserable existence.  The cages on the building serve as a reminder of the dangerous conditions. Several orbs have been captured and strange noises are a constant.
