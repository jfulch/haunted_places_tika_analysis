city: Emmetsburg
country: United States
description: There once was a motel on this sight. The people that ran the motel lived in a house across the road for a while, then the motel was demolished but the drive way is still there. Sometimes an old man in a plaid shirt and chino slacks walks along the old drive way and stops 5 or 6 times like he is checking doors. The house across the street where the people lived was still standing in 2002 and they were renovating it.
location: Vacant lot behind Nauss Oil on Highway 18
