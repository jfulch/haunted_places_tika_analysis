description: There is a former fire fighter who was killed in an accident on his way to a fire call. He was hit head on by our tanker. Late at night when your walking to the bathroom you can hear his footsteps behind you and you can feel him there. Minor occurrences of lights/TV being turned on and off. In the windows of the double doors that lead from the lounge to the bay you can see Sam's face in them. He will follow you around the bay (where the trucks are kept). There was an instance where Sam knocked the old fire helmets off the wall while one of the firefighters was sleeping on the couch. Another current instance was the papers tacked to the wall blew around as though someone was walking past at a fast pace. One experience was having the doorknob on the double doors (from lounge to bay) jiggle and the witness was the only person in the entire firehouse at the time.
