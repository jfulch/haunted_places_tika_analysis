description: in the early 1940's there was a girl that was on her way home from her high school prom and ended up driving off the side of the bridge on a stormy night. It is said that at midnight every night, you can drive to the middle of the bridge and turn off your lights and see her walking towards you in a white dress. There is a report that a girl died here in a car accident. - WARNING This is very unsafe. NEVER drive at night with your headlights off, this could result in your death or someone elseâ€™s. NO ghost is worth that. -  They reconstructed the bridge because for the previous three years there have been activities going on down there from cults. The cult burned the bridge down once a year until they decided to rebuild it.
