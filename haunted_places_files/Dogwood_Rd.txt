description: It is said that if you drive along this road after midnight occasionally you will see a girl walking alongside the road. If you stop to give her a ride she will get in, sit down, remain silent and eventually dissipate. However, it is also said that if you do not give her a ride, she will sit on top of your hood and try to make you crash. Stories say she died in a grisly accident along that road.
