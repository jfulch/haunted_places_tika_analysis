description: This is a fairly new antique store on Euclid Ave. in Downtown Ontario. If you look real closely in one of the old mirrors you can see the ghost of a young girl, maybe six or seven years old. She is smiling at you and giggling. Also, in the underground portion of the store you can hear glass shattering and a woman's frustrated screams but when you go look to see what's going on, nobody's there and no glass has been shattered.
