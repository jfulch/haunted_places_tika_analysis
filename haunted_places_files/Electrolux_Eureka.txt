description: formerly known as The old Mennonite hospital - There is this one room on the 3rd floor at the end of the hallway where a lady passed away a very painful death from cancer. After she passed the call light would always go on and off, there would be the smell of death in the room, that no matter how hard they tried it couldn't be removed. There were always strange noises coming out of the room. That room was never used again. - June 2008 Update: A worker reports they have been upstairs hundreds of time, a lot of the time, with very low lighting. They use it now as the main storage area. They call it "Dead Storage" nothing seen, heard or smelled anything out of the ordinary while being in there. No photos taken came up with anomalies. There are writings all over the walls from past patients when it was the hospital. They used this wing for the people who suffered mentally from a variety of different things. When Eureka took it over about 7 - 8 years ago, some of the employees had relatives that had been patients, so they opted not to re-wallpaper or paint the walls. The writings and pictures up there are a bit weird, but that is about it.
