description: Off of Nogales and Amar Rd there is an abandon Church where people are sacrificed and their blood is spread all over the walls, supposedly the ghost are violent. - June 2008 Correction/ additional information: the human sacrifice story is ridiculous. Though, the Church has a freaky presence around it. It's a bit secluded, tucked in the back of a hill. The only problem with that Church is it changes its religious affiliation every year or so. It was abandoned for a few years, but since has been occupied again. Thereâ€™s an RV that's always parked in front. No trespassing.
