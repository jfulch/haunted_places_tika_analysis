description: The Dartford Cemetery is an old cemetery located in town. Residents live all around it. It has been haunted for many years. The main activities are dark figures such as shadows, and figures. Noises can also be heard. Most often figures seen are of civil war era soldiers, an Indian chief that once ruled and lived in the Ripon/Green Lake/ Princeton area (he apparently died while drunk when he was bet he could not swim across the fox river. He didn't make it and drowned.) The other main figure is members of a family. The children died of a disease,possibly polio They have a large stone building for their graves which holds plots for all the family members. At times, a person may sit on the roof and get pushed off. Orbs can also be seen, and feelings of being followed and watched.
