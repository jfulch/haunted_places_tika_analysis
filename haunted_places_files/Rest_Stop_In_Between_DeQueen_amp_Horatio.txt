description: There is a hill at the exit of the rest stop. If you stop at the stop sign and put your car in neutral, you get pulled UP the hill. -  June 2005 Update: The rest stop between Horatio and De Queen is an optical illusion. While the area is on a different angle than the road, it is still on a downhill grade. Therefore, your car appears to roll UP hill. The area has been graded, and is now a driveway leading to a property.
