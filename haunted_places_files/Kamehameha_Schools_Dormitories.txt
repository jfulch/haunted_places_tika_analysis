Consequently, the boys who've seen her point out that it's a woman seen in a portrait in that dorm. they may be talking about Princess Pauahi Bishop- the young woman who had Kamehameha Schools built. And, in one of the girls' dormitories, one of the stairwells is haunted by the ghost of a young girl that died in that stairwell. She had very bad asthma and died from an asthma attack.
