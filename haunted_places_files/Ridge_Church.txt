description: Ridge Church is an old, abandoned church that was used by Satanists for a short time after it closed.  All together, it has four graveyards and a mass gravesite, most likely containing the remains of the many victims of a fire that happened in Lowndesville years ago.  People have reported seeing orbs floating over graves in broad daylight and at night, hearing sermons going on inside the church itself, hearing footsteps inside the church coming from above their heads as though someone is walking around in the bell tower, and even seeing dark figures inside the church moving around.  Many people refuse to enter the church due to a negative feeling they get upon stepping up the stairs and opening the door, as though something is "wrong" with the building.  The inside of the church itself tends to feel freezing cold even during the summer time.
