description: A 911 Operator got a call from Room 1007 in this hotel. When police investigated and found the room empty, the manager thought the call might have come from the ghost that haunts the room. The spirit is believed to be deceased night clerk who died when the former hotel on the site burned down on December 19, 1940. The current hotel was built with bricks from that hotel. Several of the hotel employees report getting calls from Room 1007 at the front desk, but when they investigate, the room is always empty.
