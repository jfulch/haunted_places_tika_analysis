description: A place that several people call the cross, but there have been a few other bodies found in the same location as well. There is a cross with a rope wrapped around it where it's said that a woman hung herself after her husband found her cheating. The rope is said to be the same one she used to hang herself with. There was also an Indian woman found there a few years back. She was killed at another location and found there later by a woman and her son. There were also two girls found in this location in the same place that had their hair dyed and razorblades in the bags that their bodies were in. They were found approximately. Fifteen feet from the cross. Just take I-40 to McLoud Exit, go south. You’ll come to a four way stop. Go strait and there will be a dirt road that comes to a Y, just keep going straight. It’s highly recommended that you park your vehicle before the curve back. It will be noticeable due to extremely deep ruts. The area is in the trees on the right side of the trail in an empty patch in the middle where there's an old partial cement barrier. That’s where the two girls were found by the cross.
