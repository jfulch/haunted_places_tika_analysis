A wide 800 square foot basement is found underneath housing possibly a ghost or unexplained disturbance according to the buildings employees whom claim at that at early evenings loud noises are heard from the basement like slamming of doors regardless they are fastened with heavy sand bags impossible to be "opened" and scratching noises on walls. It is claimed also that these disturbances may be the cause of hearing the tapping sound of an old typewriter as well.
