description: A former worker, and one of the people who helped run the place told this story. It was on a Wednesday before the regular poetry reading. A woman was awake on a couch, but she couldn’t get her eyes to open completely. With her blurred vision, she thought she saw her friend walk into the kitchen. The woman asked a man sitting in a chair near her if there was anyone else in the room. The man told her that everyone was in the kitchen. She then felt a pair of female hands grab her roughly and hold her down to the couch. She yelled out to the guy sitting in the chair, asking if there was anyone else in the room. He went to the kitchen and saw that no one was there and told her that they were the only two people there. As soon as he told her that, the hands let go. When the woman arrived for work the next day, she told her coworkers the story. She said that she had seen he r friend out of the corner of her eye, and that the friend was wearing the exact same clothes that she saw him wearing earlier that day. The other person who was with her at the time said that he had been sitting in the chair the whole time, and had seen nothing out of the ordinary. He also said that he had seen the woman’s friend walk into the kitchen. The Poet's Loft is located at 514B Central Avenue in Hot Springs, in the famous Bathhouse Row district.
