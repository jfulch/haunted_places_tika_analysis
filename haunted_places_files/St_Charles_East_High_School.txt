description: This submission is most likely a hoax due to no validation through newspapers or locals. - Before the St. Charles High School split into East and North, there was a Freshman Arab girl practicing her flute when she was brutally murdered and raped by a janitor. The girl's body was discovered in the band lockers chopped into pieces. Students say they now hear a young girl wailing and screaming, "Stop!" Occasionally a student will open a locker and say they saw a body part but a moment later it wasn't there. Janitors have said that they have heard faint flute playing but when they enter the room the music would stop and all they could see was a faint glimmer of light. Currently the female flutists say that when they leave their instrument in the lockers overnight they are misplaced in the morning and appear to have been used during the night. - June 2008 Correction: A long time resident The information on St Charles East HS in St Charles IL is a legend. They researched this through the local papers and spoke to long time residence who both attended the high school and have kids there and there has never been a report of a rape/murder of anyone at the school. No newspaper articles or personal recollections.
