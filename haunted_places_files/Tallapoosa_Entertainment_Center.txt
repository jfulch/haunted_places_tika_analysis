description: Located just on the banks of the Tallapoosa River and owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, this casino is in close proximity to some very old burial mounds. Employees have reported feelings of not being alone, as well as voices whispering in their ear when no one is standing next to them. Other odd occurrences include machines seemingly playing by themselves, screens on the machines changing displays without being touched, ice jumping out of drinks by itself, and doors opening and closing by themselves. Maintenance people on the premises even reported seeing a ghost on the far side of the parking lot when the now complete main building was still under construction. - - WARNING - This is considered FEDERAL PROPERTY/RESERVATION LAND! Make sure you are cleared with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians and the Tribal Police Department before walking around in re stricted areas on the premises!
