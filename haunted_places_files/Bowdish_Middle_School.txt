description: [Rumor] A long time ago a little before the school was made a boy named Jon was killed. Jon was between the ages 13-15. He was walking by the area of the school that was being built at around 7:00pm Pacific Time. A man in dark clothes grabbed him and stabbed him 10 times. 4 times in the face, 2 in the arm, and 4 in the chest area. A person in a car drove by and saw a body on the ground. It was Jon. They never caught the man who killed him. [Fact] At school kids and some adults see a dark figure that is blurred out in corners and darker areas. Girls and women reported seeing figures in a bathroom by the cafeteria. The figure roams the halls most of the time between 12:00 in the afternoon till about 5:00pm.
