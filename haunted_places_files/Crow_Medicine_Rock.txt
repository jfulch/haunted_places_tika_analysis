city: Pryor Mountains
country: United States
description: The Crow Indians believe that these mountains are sacred, because they are the home of a race of Little People, who protect the tribe. The Little People are said to be great meat-lovers with sharp canine teeth. Rumors of ferocious dwarfs tearing the hearts out of horses kept enemies off Crow lands, and the tribe still makes offerings to the Little People at Medicine Rock. In 1932, a mummified dwarf sitting cross-legged in a cave was found here by two prospectors.
