description: A slave owner from the 1800's beat one of his slaves to death with a logging chain. The wife of the slave had a local shaman put a curse on the slave owner. The curse was that he would bear the reminder of his murder for eternity. After he was buried, a chain appeared on his tombstone, and every year another link is added. It is located at a church called Bonds Chapel which still holds services. It is actually about five miles south (as the crow flies) from Huron.
