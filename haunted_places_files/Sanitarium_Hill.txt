description: The main building was an old tuberculosis sanitarium. There is a forest in the back that has a path that leads through it and goes to the graveyard. There is also two large smoke stacks that the dead were rumored to be burned in. The nurse' barracks were connected by a tunnel that was under ground and lead from the main building. Most of the sightings happen in the woods and right outside of the cemetery.
