description: Platte River Access - Strange This had an old bridge on it up until about 6 years ago when the state tore it down. The frame of it is still standing, however the part that you could drive on is completely gone. The bridge was too old to support traffic anymore. There is still to this day an old car that is partially buried in the riverbank that you can easily see that fell through it a long time ago. There have been reports of unusual noises, including muffled screams, footsteps in the leaves in the fall, gunshots, and voices talking from various locations on the riverbank. Platte County doesn't really have a major significance in the Civil War, however there is a history of skirmishes.
