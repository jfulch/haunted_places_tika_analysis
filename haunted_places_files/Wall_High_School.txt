description: There is sometimes footsteps heard from the roof (which is three stories up and has no stairwell leading to it). Then the footsteps stop and a soft thud is heard. This happens every year at 11:30 at night on December the twenty forth. Some call it the Santa Claus Ghost. But others believe that it was a principal that died in a freak electrical fire and was burned to death in 1930.
