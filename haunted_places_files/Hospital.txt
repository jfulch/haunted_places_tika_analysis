description: The hospital is also a nursing home and many have died there. The night staff has had call buzzers go off in the nursing home; the hospital is so old that the buzzers cannot be reset at the nurses station and have to be reset in the room. The buttons have been pushed in the men?s and ladies restrooms and the patients aren?t able to go and push the button without being moved by staff, in other words they aren?t mobile. Also the doctor for whom the hospital is named visits sometimes and leaves behind a smell of cigar smoke. As well as various elderly residents who appear as a flicker from the corner of your eye or seated in a chair down a long dark hall. There is also a tall man who seems to like to stand near the entryway and monitor that everyone is doing their job.
