description: This is the actual site of an exorcism, the event the movie is based on. The original building was torn down some years ago. The exorcism was performed on a young (perhaps 11) year old boy. After a vision of St. Michael the spirit was vanquished. The site is part of the parking lot now. It has a reoccurring crack in the pavement directly under the room the exorcism was held in. On a side note, the boy was transferred back and forth from Alexian Bros to White house estates (A catholic retreat)
