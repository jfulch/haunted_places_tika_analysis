description: Formerly a tuberculosis clinic in the heart of east Denver back in the late 1880's. It was closed down as a clinic and Remained open as an asylum between 1902 and 1906. It was believed the unethical practices of early psychology led to the untimely death of the residents. Many sightings have been reported of things such as lights within the house flickering on and off repeatedly; visions of people walking around inside a seemingly abandoned house and one instance of a male leaving the house wearing a white surgeon's mask and walking around the surrounding park. It is also believed that there was formerly a network of tunnels underground that area leading to the nearby castle of Barron Von Ricthofen himself. The house has been recently remodeled but strange instances still occur within the surrounding park and neighborhood.
