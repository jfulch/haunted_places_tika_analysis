description: There is a little graveyard just outside of Waco in China Springs. I have been out there a few times and get a really creepy feeling. Cold chills are common, pictures get interesting, and the animals act weird. And rumor has it that if you knock on a certain headstone at midnight, an apparition appears and runs at you screaming extremely loud. Also headstones tend to move around frequently.
