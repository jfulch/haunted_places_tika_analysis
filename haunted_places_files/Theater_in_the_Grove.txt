description: There is three ghosts in this theater. One lives back stage and usually only appears once to check on shows. He lived in a room back stage. He is usually seen and usually minds his own business. If you are in the changing room that is only about two doors away from the room he lived in you can sometimes here him talking. The second ghost is of a little girl. she will run up and down the walkways in the house (were people sit during performances.) the foot steps are very noisy. The third ghost is a angry ghost. There is a large iron door that leads into the light room. That is were the tech crew does all of the light and sound cues. While there the door will open very quickly and slam very hard. She will also swing the spotlights around.
