description: A young girl was raped and then beaten to death by her uncle. And before he done it he built her a dollhouse---and now if you go to her grave you will see her talking and playing with her dolls in her doll house.- March 2005 update/ correction:the little girl was NOT raped by her uncle. The story is - The little girl was killed by a piano which was dropped by the mover her parents hired. Her parents put her 'dollhouse' on her grave because it was her favorite place to play. Also it is told that if you see the light on in the doll house at night she is there playing. Former caretakers of that cemetary report until the new caretaker built a house at the end of the drive. The new caretaker now has a gate up and noone is allowed down the drive from dusk til dawn. Also the story of the light didn't start until YEARS after the little girl was buried. Due to the eccessive amount of partying from teenagers and sickening graffetti as well as littering, the former care taker took a light and a car battery and placed it inside the doll house and would turn it on at night. Also he repainted the doll house. Since then there has been NO defaceing of the property, littering, or teens out partying in the graveyard. After the caretaker moved into his new home the light has been removed.
