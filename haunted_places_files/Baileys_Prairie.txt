description: During the 1800s, Brit Bailey died a natural death. His widow arranged his burial according to her wishes and let out a few of his requests, namely his jug of moonshine. He is said to return every 7 years in search of his jug in the form of a large fireball. He is even said to have caused a gas well blowout when they drilled too close to his actual grave. His resting place is a little off State 35 between West Columbia and Angleton. This is and remains a very old haunting, as this area is quite active in the paranormal sense.
