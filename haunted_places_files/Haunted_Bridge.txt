description: Back in the 1960's, a teenaged girl could not accept the teasing and taunting of the students at Jennings County High School.  One evening around midnight, she jumped from one of the local bridges killing herself.  Though her body was found, to this day people driving across the bridge at around midnight have reported seeing a young girl jump from the bridge, though after searching no bodies are ever found.
