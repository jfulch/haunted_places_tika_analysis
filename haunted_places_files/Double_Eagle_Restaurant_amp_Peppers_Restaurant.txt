description: ghosts have been photographed and witnessed here. An aristocratic residence on the plaza was built in 1849. Here, a petite Spanish maid, Inez, was stabbed to death by the mother, Senora Maese, of her lover, Armando. The son was stabbed himself and died just days later. The Carlotta Room, the scene of the tragedy, has a reputation for cold spots, a woman's laughter, the apparition of a small woman in black skirt and white blouse, and the strong scent of perfume. Double Eagle restaurant and Peppers grill are both in the same building.
