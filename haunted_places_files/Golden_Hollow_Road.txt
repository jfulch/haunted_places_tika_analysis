description: Back in the 1950's there were two cars that hit head on. It happened during the springtime. All 7 occupants died, 4 in one car and 3 in the other. On a warm spring night when the flowers are coming out, you will see several people walking. They will appear to be injured. As you get close enough to ask them if they need help, they all disappear. All you will be left with is a chill for your trouble.
