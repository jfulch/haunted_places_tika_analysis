description: At 4:25 every Friday in the hallway near the old gym, you can hear the sounds of a boy coming down the hall dribbling a basketball. Shortly following you can hear the screams of the boy and banging on the lockers as if being attacked. Legend has it that in the 1970's a 9th grader was killed there before a big football game against rival Brecksville as a prank by 2 seniors.
