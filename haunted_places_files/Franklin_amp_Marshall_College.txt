description: Apparently in the late 1970's a female freshman committed suicide in her room on the third floor of South Ben Franklin dormitory because she could not handle the college's intense workload. Since that time, whenever winter finals grow near, there are reports of screams in the night, sightings of a ghostly figure wandering the halls with a physics book, and even the appearance of blood on the floor of her former room.
