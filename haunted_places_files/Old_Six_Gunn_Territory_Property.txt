description: Once the land, which now is filled partially by a shopping center, was the location of "Six Gunn Territory" a attraction which lasted many years. On this site 2 tourists were killed, both accidentally. It is said at certain times screams are heard and upon investigation, nothing is found. Some remains of the rail-road which visitors would ride can still be located among a heavily wooded area. The rail car was a factor in one of the deaths. The park was closed in the early 80's.
