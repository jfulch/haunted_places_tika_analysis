description: During the recent construction of Holt High School a young man was working on the catwalk over the stage in the auditorium.  While he was working he fell over the rail and went head-first into the stage, covering everything within 5 feet with his blood.  It is said that you can feel an eerie presence while in the Auditorium. Other accounts from actors using the stage say they would feel a hand grab their shoulder and turn around only to find out no one is there.
