description: A woman in a flowing white bridal gown has been seen wandering and peeking from behind the trees many times over the years. She never makes a sound but some have come close to her and it's said that she wears a veil to cover her face. No one knows who she may be, however, there is a grave yard and a church at the bottom of the hill...most certainly her final resting place. She is simply called, "The Bride".
