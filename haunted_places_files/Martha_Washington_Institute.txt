description: sometime in the 40s-50s a janitor at this women’s institution weft crazy and murdered several patience and some staff before being subdued by police. Its said that he, carried the bodies to a near by dock and threw several into the water. Me and some friends got drunk and decided to test our nerves by walking the grounds "only a foundation, dock and small forest "we split up and one friend Jessie fell down several times claiming to have been grabbed by some force around the ankles "small scratches around the sock area confirmed this". I heard what I believe to be footsteps and a woman or child crying. Natives to Rainer Ave don’t go near it and cursed us when we pulled over to ask directions.
