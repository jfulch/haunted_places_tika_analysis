description: Hogback Road - Road is one of those roads that has winter snow removal on half, and none on the other. The latter is a winding stretch of half gravel half pavement that's no fun to drive on no matter what time of year. Down in a gully on this "bad" stretch, there is an old wooden bridge that crosses Hogback Run. It has been said that, years ago, a group of Satan worshippers sacrificed a young woman. To this day, numerous witnesses have heard screaming coming from the gully, and their headlights have turned off when the car is parked on the bridge at night. Others have said to feel "cold" spells on warm nights. - October 2004 correction: There were several established Indian campsites located in the hills and upon bright nights of a full moon in October and November (the Hunter's Moon, if you stand quietly on the road, you will feel their spirits pass you and see glowing orbs in the hollows of the hills. Some have reported seeing the ghost of a young warrior standing by a tree at the crest of the hill.
