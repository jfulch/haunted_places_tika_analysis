description: Formerly the site of Austin State School - There are several buildings that have had sightings and sounds by staff members. This old place was built over a cemetery. The cemetery is that of the patients that expired in the early part of this century. But recently to show proof that this never took place a coffin popped out of the ground right next to one of the condemned buildings. - April 2005 update: the school has been torn down. If there was any evidence of the bodies, they have been removed.
