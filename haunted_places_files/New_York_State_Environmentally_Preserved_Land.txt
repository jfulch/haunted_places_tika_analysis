description: This 100 acre woodland, on the northern boundary of Wyoming County, was sectioned off by the state and preserved in its original ecological state. It is now a park, where nothing is built aside for a few dirt roads and horse riding trails. A number of people have reported seeing apparitions of Indians being massacred here. It is also said that once a year during the summer months, residents from the neighboring Indian Reservation will come up to the state lands and disappear into the woods until morning.
