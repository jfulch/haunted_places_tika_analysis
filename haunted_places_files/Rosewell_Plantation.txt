description: The Page Family Mansion built in the early 1600's. Several generations lived in the mansion before it burned down. Several walls are still standing from the 4-story building. The graveyard for the family is off to the side of the house, as part of the extensive grounds. Many occurrences have been reported; the drop in air temperature by a good 15 degrees or more, apparitions, strange noises, the sound of slaves coming from the fields, reportedly a young woman walks down the front steps every night.
