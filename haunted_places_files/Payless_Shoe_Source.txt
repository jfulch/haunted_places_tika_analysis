description: There are reports of a little boy that appears in the break room at the back of the store. Legend says that the little boy came into the store with his mother and wanted a pair of shoes really bad. His mother didn't buy it for him and he was quite upset. Ran out the store and was hit by a car. This store has not kept employees for long because each time a new employee sees the apparition, they just quit without telling anyone. It is said that the boy appears right before the store opens and right before it closes at night.
