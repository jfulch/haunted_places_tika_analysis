description: The Weaver House (torn down)  Get on Trenton road and head towards Deerfield. Go past willow dr., and less than an 1/8 of a mile there will be a traffic light and on the left will be a red broken down house with spray paint on it. This is the house lost in a fire owned by the Weavers. The fire killed some members of the family and their graves are on top of a hill past the house on the left. Look hard and you'll find it. A ghost has been seen walking with a lamp into the woods and up to the grave sight.
