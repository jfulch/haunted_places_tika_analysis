description: Locals claim the ghost of soldier George Fikes will haunt the person you name if you perform a ritual that involves jumping over the grave, spitting, and lying on the grave while reciting the appropriate chant. None of the kids I grew up with was ever brave enough to perform the entire ritual, but the last time I was there were still bare spots on either side of the grave.
