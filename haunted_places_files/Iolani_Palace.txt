description: A smell of flowers or bubble gum can be smelt around the grounds. Unexplainable shadows and lights seen by security guards. The sounds of foot steps can also be heard. - August 2004 update: (The smell of the bubble gum is actually the blossoms from a tree that grows in the area. In fact, the bubble gum smell isn't just limited to the Iolani Palace grounds, but you can also smell the "bubble gum" over a block away)
