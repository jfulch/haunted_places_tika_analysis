description: Just right off of BB Hwy. Theres a sight where the old rail road tracks used to be. It is reported a man Fell asleep on the railroad track back in the 1930's. The man supposidly walking trying to find his light and got tired and fell asleep, after walking so far. As the story goes a train came along and before the guy could get up the wheel of the rail road engine severed his head. Thy Myth is that he walks the railroad with the light he finally found after being killed continuing to look for his head. I my self have not witnessed this, but have heard many stories about it from different people, all telling me the same story.
