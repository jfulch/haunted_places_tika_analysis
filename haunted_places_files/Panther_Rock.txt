description: Back in the 1960's there was a woman riding along on her horse. A slick black panther came out of the woods with the taste for blood. The panther startled the horse. The horse throw the woman off and she hit her head on a jaggit rock and was sreaming for help. If you go up there at night when it is raining and get out of your car. You can hear the woman screaming for help and the panthers bone chilling cries. The rain on the rock will turn red from where the panther slatured her and all goes quiet.
