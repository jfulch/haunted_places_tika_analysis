city: Vermillion/Meckling
country: United States
description: This house has been long abandoned, strange noises from the top floor have been heard, and a girl who went in was hit on the chest, resulting in a bruise in the shape of a perfect triangle. Some think that it may be the ghost of a school superintendent who hung himself when the Meckling school was dissolved.
