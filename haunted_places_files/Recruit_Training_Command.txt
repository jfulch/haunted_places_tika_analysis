description: Recruit training command AKA boot camp for the navy is haunted my many spirits. In ship 12 you can hear a woman's scream loudly and fade within seconds. In ship 13, you sometimes will see a figure of a recruit who hung himself. In ship 15, which was once reported as a mental loony bin that caught on fire killing many people. Throughout the night, you will see figures and shadows walking around. Sometimes a ghost will whisper in your ear " Reveille Reville" This has happened to many people as well. One time a coat hanger flew off the wall, over the fan that was on at the time, and hit a friend of mine on the head. I was witness to it.
