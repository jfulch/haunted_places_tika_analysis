description: Union Chapel is on Michigan Ave. just passed Inkster Rd. It sits up on a hill and is easy to miss if you don't know where it is. There is a grave marker of a little girl aged 9 years old by the name of Mary Jane Walker who died Jan. 6 1866. If you ask her she may allow her picture to be taken. I tried this and got one picture that shows a vortex.
