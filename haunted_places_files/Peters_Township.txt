description: Montour Trail "HELL" - Reports of unexplained lights that don’t shine. A short figure that has green eyes and a white hand on its left side. A little girl in a white dress that follows people. Strange noises, feeling of being followed. Outside one tunnel always rocks falling from the road, even thought the road is paved. There was supposedly a train wreck in the late 1800’s or early 1900’s where the trail is now located.
