city: Fort Morgan
country: United States
description: Trails run for more than a mile from Riverside Park, to the Ponds, with swamp like land and thick woods. The trail runs all along the South Plate River, and the whole way to the Ponds, you can hear and sense spirits. Some people have become possessed, or followed by spirits. Rumors have called her the River Witch, a woman in the 1900's who practiced the dark arts, and was treated very badly by all of Fort Morgan's residents, so one night she was sick of it and walked into the river, killing herself. Most of the spirits revolve around her. You can feel the bad energy out there, and you hear them, and can see glowing eyes in the trees.
