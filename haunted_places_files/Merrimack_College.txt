description: Ash Hall - There is a mysterious fire ghost who roams Ash Hall. He wears a charred and blackened firemanâ€™s outfit, and often wields an axe. A fire alarm sounds during the night on many occasions sending students outside into the dark night. Here they may catch a glimpse of his darkened figure in various dorms windows, while they listen to the sound of the sirens rushing to the scene to secure the false alarm. Students return to a scent that is often described as being similar to that of a smoldered burnt out campfire and fire traces of ash and soot on doorknobs and handrails, though a single flame is never found.
