description: If you drop a rock in the well at the middle of the cemetery at night, you can hear a baby cry. It has been said that you can even see and hear the babyâ€™s mother running through the graveyard, near the old burned down church. The story is told of a woman who was near the well drawing out water, before it was a graveyard. She sat the child on the edge of the well, and the baby fell in and drowned.
