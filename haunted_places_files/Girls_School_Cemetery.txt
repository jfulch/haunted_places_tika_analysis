description: shallow graves - Once an industrial school for girls, there is now a little subdivision. Although the school is gone the graveyard for it is still around. A graveyard thatâ€™s about a hundred years old, just the feeling in the air is creepy. Supposedly late at night you can see a young girl (probably from the school)runs through the woods behind the little cemetery. sometimes you will see to glowing eyes in the trees.
