description: It is said that a white apparition of a female frequents the Old English Building. This building is located at the front of the school, near the end of Washington Street. Apparently, a girl student was attending the school dance. She was taken to the basement by two males where she was raped and murdered. Students, staff, as well as custodians, have seen and heard her in the building. Her spirit can be seen from the street walking from one end of the building to the other, as if she was walking through the walls.
