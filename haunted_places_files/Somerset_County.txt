Almost every night, the door to their security trailer was knocked on. They would open the door to find no one there. Recent photos taken at a small memorial set up there revealed SEVERAL orbs. One of the guards heard a man's voice in the cab of his truck ask, "So What now?" This was reported on by Johnstown, PA's news station WJAC.
