city: Shepherdsville
country: United States
description: Just off of Brooks Road, just before you cross the railroad tracks there is a turnoff to your right. Down a little further to your left is an old house(more like castle with red pointed tower-like structures). You can't see it from the road but you can pull right up next to the old iron gates. It is said that the man who once lived there killed his wife and children. Lack of evidence though, he could not be convicted. If you pull up next the iron gates at night an scream at the gates, you can hear the wife and children screaming for help! It is better that you go alone. If you go alone it rules out all possibilities of echos.
