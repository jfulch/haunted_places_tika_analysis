description: Sounds has been said to be haunted for years by a bride and also possibly by another figure, a man. When you walk into the establishment, some people are said to have felt a presence in the room and many times feel"heaviness" in their head which sometimes turns into a different sort of headache. Sometimes the presence felt is a sort of sadness, "heavy-hearted." There were two pictures taken by my family that have shown orbs in them.
