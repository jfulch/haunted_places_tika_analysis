description: It is said that 3 ghost haunt the school. There is a young man believed to be 16-18 haunting the school. Back in the 70's the boy was playing basketball for his PE class, as he went up for a shot someone took his legs out from under him and he crushed his skull and broke his neck. Late at night after hours you can hear the young man playing and you can encounter a ghostly figure walk up to you and ask " Do u got game "? then laugh and disappear. The other two ghosts seem to be a couple. They are seen all over the school every now and then. They will disappear when see by other people. The couple will follow and mess with you until you leave.
