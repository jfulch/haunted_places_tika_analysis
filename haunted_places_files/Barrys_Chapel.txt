description: Off Route 77 and down a long dirt road, there are the remains of an old church. It was built by a man with the last name of Barry many years ago. His wife had mysteriously died. In a separate incident, his church burned down around the same time as his wife's death. He later became guilt stricken and went to the site of the burnt down church only to hang himself from a tree in the churchyard. If you go there at night, you will see the church as if it was never burnt. If you kick the foundation, the church bell will ring.
