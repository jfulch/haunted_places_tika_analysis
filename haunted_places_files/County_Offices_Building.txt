description: there have been many strange and unusual happening in the building, mostly at night when a lonely deputy is on duty making copies in the office or just simply sitting down and having a cup of coffee, Report seeing people out of the corner of their eye when the building is empty. He shook it off again and went back to his reports when suddenly he turned around and there standing in front of him was an old man wearing a blue bathrobe and blue slippers. He said the old man just looked up at him and turned around and walked out.. The deputy, not realizing what had just happened, followed the man out the door, but when he reached the hallway, there was no one to be found! Another unexplained happening happened around the same time when the Emergency Management Director was sitting in his office early in the morning and was drinking a cup of coffee when suddenly someone slapped the back of his chair and sent him flying up on top of his desk! When he turned around to investigate, he realized that no one was in the room with him, let alone, no one was even in the building at the time of the event!
