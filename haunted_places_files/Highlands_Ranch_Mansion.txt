city: Highlands Ranch
country: United States
description: There is a mansion on S. Ranch Road that was built in the 1890's. The owner of the ranch and his family lived there. There was a single daughter who was forced to stay in the house all day, every day to clean and cook while the other men were out in the fields. She's still alive, she's 97. It's the impression of her sadness that haunts the mansion. A great example of a residual haunting that happens even though the person is not dead.
