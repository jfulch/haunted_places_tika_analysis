description: In the small town of Lemont (in state college), there are many large Victorian houses. At the first intersection, under the street there is a tunnel used by the under ground rail road and it connects to several houses. In the Lemont house (the tunnel begins here) there is said to be the ghost of a woman, who supposedly either died or killed herself when her husband died. The house was a present for her wedding and she was so heart broken she refused to live there. Her father built her another house down the street. There are many secret passageways etc.
