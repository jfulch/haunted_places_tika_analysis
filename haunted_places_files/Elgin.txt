description: Jazz Man - The story goes that a jazz musician was walking across the Second Creek Bridge when a car struck him. He walks up and down the bridge, still wearing his white Zoot suit, looking for a ride to Florence. If you stop to pick him up, he says something about his trumpet and disappears.
