description: There are various versions of a little Amish girl being killed in the Mondale Road bridge.  The 'thing to do' is pull into the bridge, and stop in the middle.  Turn off your car, turn off your lights.  Various versions of the story describe in some way her apparition climbing over your car, or walking through your car.  A few people that tried this have had hand prints over their car that they didn't notice until they saw their car in daylight.
