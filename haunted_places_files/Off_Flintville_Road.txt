description: The Flintville Light has been a haunt for many years. Many young lovers go there and try to see the Light. Most think it is just a way to get your sweetheart in a parked car on a dark deserted road. Many have gone there to park, to spend time alone together. While they are there, a mysterious light appears from the old railroad track. The light will appear to come towards you. The story behind the light is that a local was out walking the track and was run over by a speeding train. His body parts was scattered for 150 yards. The story of the light has been around for decades. Even though the railroad tracks are gone, you can still see the chilling light as it makes it way towards. As the light appears to be very close, it just up and disappears.
