description: Toltec Elementary School 3 angry dark shadows roam at night for a girl that was raped and left for dead there. You can hear the voices even hear the screams of the girl. And under the bridge where the 3 shadows dwell very strong negative vibe. If you take photographs you will come up with dark shadows at least 7 foot tall. And you can also hear movement from all playground equipment.
