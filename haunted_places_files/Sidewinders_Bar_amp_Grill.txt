city: Murtaugh
country: United States
description: Sidewinders was built in 1908.? Murtaugh, its townspeople, nearby Milner damn and irrigation workers, as well as Union Pacific workers suffered losses and unimaginable hardships back then.? For most of its existence this historic building served as the towns main gathering spot, message center, watering hole, gamblin' joint, not to mention, place of ill repute.? Through the years, many have witnessed a passing shadow, heard laughter, or tuned in to the saloon's piano playing at a distance.? These experiences most generally happen at different times, when patrons clear, leaving one sometimes two people to witness.?? Most notably and occurring frequently, the volume of the stereo or jukebox will peak to the max without warning or help from anyone close by. Rich in history and revered as a place to unwind, visit, and relax, no haunting experience at Sidewinders has ever been deemed threatening, violent, or harmful.???
