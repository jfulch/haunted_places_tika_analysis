description: While rehearsing on stage, several cast members have reportedly seen an old couple sitting in the balcony observing. To their astonishment, the specters would eventually disappear. Many people are of the opinion that they were the former owners of the theatre, who were apparently curious of the goings on in the establishment. The old Collins theatre was built in 1928, a year later than its sister theatre, the Strand, in Jonesboro.
