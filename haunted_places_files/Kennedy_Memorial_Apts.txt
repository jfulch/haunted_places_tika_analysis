description: Gym - late at night you could hear someone playing basketball, you see a shadow standing in the stage. the restrooms are haunted as well, they open the water and the toilets flush by themselves, and slam the doors. When you're standing in the middle of the gym or even walking around they push you and start messing with you. Security has reported this strange activity, but it's nothing but ghosts!!!!
