description: El Cado Cemetery - Witnesses claim to have seen a misty-white figure darting between the trees, and heard lots of strange noise such as voices, laughing, rattling and clanking. It has become a popular "party spot" for the young people, many of who have gone there with a "no fear" attitude...only to flee in fear due to an unexplainable experience they cannot justify. When asked, most said they would NEVER go back again.
