description: A rumor around here says that the spirit of a 12-year-old boy haunts this Boy Scout camp. Apparently while playing one day, he was swinging when he jumped, and hit his head on a 5-inch rock. Some say he was killed instantly, some slow and painfully. This happened 3 years ago. Anyway, a swing moving at the same height never higher never lower. Even creepier, there is never a breeze when this happens some say. I've only been going for a year, but it's been the same condition as they say. Some have even heard a giggle.
