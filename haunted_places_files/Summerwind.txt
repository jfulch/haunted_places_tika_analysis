description: Shadowmen walk the grounds, pin holes of light float thru the trees, and scariest of all, the foundation and the landscape change at will. you measure a doorway one minute, and the next, its a few inches larger. Whatâ€™s strange is that there are beautiful flowers that grow all over the remains of Summerwind during the night, but when you return during the day, there is nothing. - December 2006 Update: Summerwind was purchased by a private party approx 20 years ago. It was under renovations to possibly reopen as a Bed & Breakfast. The owners put a gate up so you could no longer visit the property. It ended up burning down shortly after.
