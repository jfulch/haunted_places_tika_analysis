description: The Alpha Xi Delta house - is a historic house located on Fifth St. William P. Skinner, successful early merchant, second sheriff, bank board member and civic leader, built this house in 1855. His daughter, Sarah, married Nahum Ward. In 1908 it was purchased by George White, an oilman and banker who was elected Governor of Ohio in 1930. He is the third Marietta native to achieve this honor. Since 1955 it has served as the Alpha Xi Delta sorority house. The house is currently haunted by the spirit of "George". He has been known to knock things off the walls, open doors, turn on faucets, and turn on and off appliances. He also protects the girls of the house. It is rumored that if a girl brings a guy up stairs he will trip them going up the front stairs if his intentions are not true.
