description: On cary-algonquin road across the street from fox trails are the foundations of an old burnt down retirement home.  with over 6 deaths when the building fell in the late 80's, many find this spot to be a hotbed for spirit activity.  many have experienced hot areas where the fire once burned and several wandering spirits in the woods.  on one or more occasions spirits have been photographed.
