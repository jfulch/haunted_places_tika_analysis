description: 413 - in the front of the complex outside, in the late 1970's two young girls were staying there for the night.  They went downtown and picked up a guy from a local bar and brought him back to their room.  While the other girl was out smoking, the guy drowned her female friend in the bathtub and put her body under the bed.  Then while leaving he went down the back stairwell outside beside the kitchen and found the other girl smoking, then he proceeded to strangle her as well, and drug her body to the roof of the building (then easily accessible).  Maids over the years have reported hearing noises from the bathroom and objects in the room moving from one place to another, while cleaning the room.
