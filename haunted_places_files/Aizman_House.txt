description: Orbs have been sighted on several occasions in the living room and basement after 10:30. Halloween trick-or-treaters have ran out after having a tour of the basement, and it's "friends". The orbs and apparition of a man with only eyes and a mouth, dressed in a gray sweater with his white collar showing and blue jeans, are believed to be victims of "kid can" and his gang.
