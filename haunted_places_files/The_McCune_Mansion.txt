description: Doors locking that don't have locks on them, cold spots, as the owner drives away he looks into the rear view mirror and sees lights going on and of all through out the unoccupied house. The mansion is haunted by a little blonde girl, about 11 or 12 years old. She has been seen walking in and out of the big mirror on the west wall. She has been seen walking the rooms and been known to rearrange items and indeed lock doors. People that have seen her say that she look like a young girl depicted in a painting hanging the house. Lights come on at all hours of the night and witnesses have seen footprints that begin and end in the middle of the room.
