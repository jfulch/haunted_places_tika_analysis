country: United States
description: Lamps would be on after the residents had turned them off in the morning, reports of a glass slowly edged its way into the sink and shattered as if someone pushed it. Often times while there alone the scent of lavender would waft passed our noses for 2 seconds. It is a rumor that the place is built a top a cemetery that was moved down the street; only the bodies are rumored to still be in the ground.
