description: This stretch of forest is said to be haunted by the ghosts of a settlement of freed slaves. The people set up a small settlement in the flat-forested region shortly after the civil war. It is said that the KKK burned the little town one night and killed a large number of the residents. A few buildings still stand out there, and lights have been seen among them at dusk. There are also reports of the smell of burning meat on foggy nights.
