description: The original house belonging to Chief Richardsville has been remodeled by adding a door between the Chief's bedroom and the servant's quarters to facilitate tours of the house. In the room described as the servant's quarters there was a pillar of icy air that everyone who walked passed through shivered and said, "ooooh....cold spot" The cold spot was WAY colder than the temperature in the rest of the house including being several degrees lower than the outside temperature. There also was a strong sense of being watched.
