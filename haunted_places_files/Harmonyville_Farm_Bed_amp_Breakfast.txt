description: "Person" seen standing outside of shower in "Summer Kitchen" cottage. Painting of woman in cottage was glaring and frowning at beginning of visit, and when visitors (friends of mine) left a day early, she appeared to then be smirking. At one point, one of the visitors couldn't get the door to the Summer Kitchen open to get out, and just as she was about to give up, it clicked and opened. They constantly felt as though the walls were closing in, and did not realize that both of them were experiencing the same things until they talked in the car on their way out of there. General overall "creepy, claustrophobic" feeling about the place.
