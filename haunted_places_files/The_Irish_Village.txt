description: On the basement floor of the main office is where the old pub used to be. Not many people go down there, but people have seen the toilets all of a sudden start to overflow, and mysterious toys, usually a clown, sitting on top of the toilet. Most say that the clown "looks right at you" even though it is only a toy.
