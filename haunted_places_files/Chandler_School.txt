description: The school was shut down around 1990-91.It is said to be haunted by a janitor that was doing one of his many jobs and a board fell from the ceiling and killed him. It is also said to be haunted by a little boy who had an asthma attack during lunch one day. Lights still turn on and off and there is no electricity. December 2006 Additional Information: There always had stories of the janitor that haunted the halls. There was an old wall-piano that was supposed to be sent to the local High School. One day, it was sitting on a landing. The next day, it was in shambles at the bottom of the stairs. Chandler has since been reopened. It is an apartment building for elderly folks.
