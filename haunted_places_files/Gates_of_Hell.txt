description: A long time a go a man owned this property, he hung people out in his feild the tale is if you park down by the gate.. turn off your car you can see people walking out in the field, a little boy lurks around the gate. and you can hear odd noises. It's been known for your car not to start back up. It's a very freaky place. People own the property now they have horses but if you go down there on a full moon you can't see the horses anywhere... you can search the fields up and down and wont find any kind of sigh of a horse.
