city: Sheridan
country: United States
description: The Historic Sheridan Inn is haunted by the spirit of a woman who was a caretaker, seamstress, waitress, and many other things from the time it opened at the turn of the century until her death in the late 50's or early sixties- "Miss Kate" has made noises, startled guests, turned lights on and off, and even set the fire alarm off several times one night to warn of a soon to happen fire in the kitchen- Her ashes are behind the wall of her third floor room, and you can sometimes see her rocking chair rocking by itself. Other ghostly inhabitants include a little girl, and the spirit of the son-in-law of Buffalo Bill Cody, the man who built the Inn. He shot himself in one of the rooms.
