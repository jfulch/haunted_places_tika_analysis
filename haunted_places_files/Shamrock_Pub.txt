description: The Shamrock, on Front Street, is reported haunted. The building was built in the late 1800's, and was originally a furniture store doubling as a funeral home. It was common for furniture makers to build caskets years ago. The building was converted to a bar years later (I think the 1930's). Most of the hauntings are late at night, after the bar has closed.
