description: Until fairly recently (1999 or 2000) this place was off limits to just about everyone. It was part of Ft. Knox, only accessible from a couple of dirt roads across the street from the old US Cav. store. Itâ€™s now been opened to the public and made into a park. There are the remains of the old pump houses and tanks for when this was the main water source for Ft. Knox and Radcliff. On all of my visits (both before and after it being opened to the public) I have been plagued with the feeling of being watched. There is also a distinct aura of wrongness about the reservoir. The water is so murky that visibility is about 2ft at most.
