description: Sometime back in the 1800's, a man stole a horse from one of his neighbors. Mind you, this was a punishable by death in those days. After committing his crime he decided to go to the Walker House for a drink. The Walker House is a large restaurant/bar/hotel. While he was in the bar, a mob came, dragged him out of the bar and promptly hung him on a tree outside. Since then he has haunted the Walker House. Visitors and employees have seen floating heads, felt cold drafts, been locked in the walk-in freezers and several other mischievous things.
