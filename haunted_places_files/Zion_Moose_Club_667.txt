description: The land that the Moose now stands on was the previous site of a home, which burned down in the 1940's. A young girl 8 years old died in the house fire -- patrons of the Moose have repeatedly seen the ghost of a young blonde haired girl playing in the facility, have experienced lights flickering, doors slamming, and have heard strange, giggling noises from a child that isn't there. Members have named their resident ghost "Mary" and acknowledge her upon entering and exiting the facility.
