country: United States
description: on a road just out of Rensselaer, there are two cemeteries, on each side of the road. Legend has it, that there was a young couple whose families didn't get along. They decided to kill themselves Romeo and Juliet style. They left in their notes to be buried side by side. Their families didn't honor their wishes and put them in different cemeteries. Late at night, if you drive there and park your car between the two cemeteries, and shut your lights off, you can see a brunette women in white and a man in black walking across the road to meet each other. Warning: If you shut your car off, it will not start again. Also, the woman was from a religious family, so it is said that if you supposedly cuss, you submit yourself do the danger of being attacked.
