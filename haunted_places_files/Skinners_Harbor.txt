description: Apparently years back, a boy got into a horrible accident involving a dump truck. Although details are limited, it's known that he suffered massive head/face trauma that led him to his death. People say that late at night you can still hear the horn and the sickening crush of the young boy against the pavement. There are reports of seeing the mangled child floating in nearby waters also.
