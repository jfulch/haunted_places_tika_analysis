description: Tall stone monument that overlooks Sioux Falls north side near the cemetery is the place where a South Dakota farmer / judge Mr. Amidon was killed by American Indians in an uprising as he plowed his field.  His 14 -year-old son was sh`t to death with arrows through his chest as he tried to help his father as well.  The monument is dedicated in their honor.  Strange feelings of being watched are found here as well as occasional orb lights.  It's not known due to the very close proximity to the cemetery very close by if the spirits are from there or the judge and his son.
