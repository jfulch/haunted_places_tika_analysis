description: Hollybrook is a retirement community. LATE at night on certain nights, as you're leaving this community, if you're driving over the speed limit (15mph), as you are approaching a stop sign, an old lady, almost glowing, appears on the left hand side of the road wearing a flowing pink night gown and motions you to slow down. As you pass her, she stares at you in disgust. You can watch her disappear in your rear view mirror.
