description: people claim that they hear people playing upstairs. They also claim that they feel something touching their face and arms. Some people even say that they see figures in their windows and sitting in chairs. On the 3rd floor of the Driskill Hotel in one of the hallways there is a painting of a little girl holding flowers, witnesses report when they all looked at the picture a weird sensation came over them. It was like something was lifting up the heels of their feet. It was like a tingling sensation. Causing their equilibrium to be off for the next few hours.
