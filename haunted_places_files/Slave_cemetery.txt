city: Brattonsville
country: United States
description: It is on Burkins road. It is basically woods, and every hole you step in is a slave. If you go through the woods for a while, you will come up to a tombstone about 3 feet tall. You can barely read it, but it is the tombstone of Watt,he was likely an important slave. Behind it is a rock lying on the ground, and underneath it is his wife. Next to it if you shine the light, you can see the sunken in ground where a slave is lying, and you can also see where the wife is laying. Its incredibly scary. You get a really weird feeling if you stand on in a grave in the pitch black.Make sure you bring flash lights. -  March 2004 Update/ additional info:Watt was the slave that ran from Brattonsville to retrieve Col. Bratton and inform him that a group of British loyalists were headed toward Brattonsville. Col. Bratton returned and defeated Capt. Huck's men, hence the Battle of Huck's Defeat.
