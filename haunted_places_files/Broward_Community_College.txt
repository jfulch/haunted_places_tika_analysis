description: Central - Two years ago, a guy went psycho and shot his ex-girlfriend in the back of the head between classes. He then killed himself. Both died between Building 5 and another building. Students exiting their night classes report seeing white figures and strange smells from that corner. Also, a permanent blood stain still remains on the ground.
