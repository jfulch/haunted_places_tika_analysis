description: Apparitions and voices, a feeling of dread have been reported. - October 2003 Update - Popular in the 1920's. What few people know about is the old cemetery a couple hundred feet off the trail leading to the bluffs. Reason enough, some would say to see a few spirits. The thing dates back to the 1790's when the bluffs were used as a look out point for the continental army, watching for Indians along the trade route, from North Carolina to what was the lost state of Franklin(now Tennessee). A small post was there and they were attacked by a rouge band of the peaceful Cherokee. Most were slaughtered in there sleep.
