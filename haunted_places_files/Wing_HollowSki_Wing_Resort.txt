description: This place was a nice ski resort which opened in the late 1950s.  In the 60s/70s, several people were crushed/dismembered in a lift accident, a little boy drowned in the pond at the base, and a janitor in the chalet was shot in the head executioner-style by the two people who robbed the place for $17,000.  They were never caught. Reported white figures in the road, people walking with ski-equipment, man following you in the chalet, little boy screaming, your car stalls at the base of the hill and you see white faces in the rear window.
