description: the ghost of Zona Heaster Shue appeared to her mother about two weeks afer her death to show her the truth of her untimely death. Zona's husband was abusive and had pushed her down the stairs in a fit of rage. He told authorities that she had just fallen. However, Zona's mother never trusted her son-in-law and didn't believe his story, so she prayed that Zona would return to her and enlighten her with the truth. Zona heeded her mother's request and showed her mother what had really happened, and this manifestation brought about the arrest and conviction of the husband.
