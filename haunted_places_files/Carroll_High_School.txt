description: It is believed that Carroll High School is cursed and haunted. Every year a junior student dies surprisingly, and eventually the student comes back to haunt and be known. One example,(not mentioning the name), a girl who died, came back to be remembered. A day after her death, in class, a boy took her original seat and fell off. To everyone's surprise, they asked him if he was alright. He then replied, in a shocked look, "No, not really." The teacher asked why. He replied back "I didn't fall, I was pushed."
