description: Library - The library which was once the summer cottage of Murry and Leonie Guggenheim is haunted by the ghost of a lady in white who walks down the staircase overnight at midnight. No one is allowed there past 11:30, they close it down (conveniently) before 12. Upstairs and all inside the house you have the feeling that you truly don't belong and someone wants you to leave.
