description: The old orphanage has 18 buildings, 16 of which are connected by catacombs. Legend has it that children were abused and beaten and sent down to the boiler room for punishment. The orphanage has been closed down for some time now. Some explorers found a door leading to a basement of one of the buildings that was left ajar and entered. they found the tunnel that led to the boiler room with another tunnel leading out of it. Other very small rooms were attached to the tunnels, possibly for solitary confinement. It was creepy and cold spots and cool breezes were felt every once in a while. Up in one of the rooms must have been a girl's dorm, dolls and lunch boxes, books, etc. scattered over the floor, they all had very weird sensations that they were being watched. The attic of the main building is said to be the most haunted. Also reports of seeing children watching you from the windows. The whole place was vacant and abandoned at that time.- October 2004 update: this area is being renovated into housing development.
