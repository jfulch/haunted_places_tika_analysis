description: There is a "charred lady" apparently seen in Amelia Wildlife Reserve, as well as other apparitions. There have been at least two murders/bodies found in there. In the early 90s, the middle aged female victim of a brutal joy-ride rape-murder was found dumped near the entrance of the reserve (note: the case was hushed by local officials, inexplicably, couldnâ€™t find out even the victims name...the case has never been solved). 4 years ago, another female corpse was found near the lake/dam area, within a small cove, also a nighttime lovers lane - party spot for teen urchins. The dam nearby is the same one where a woman has been seen (dragging a body) in the past.
