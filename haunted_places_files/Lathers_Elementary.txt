description: The local rap group L3 was being hunted down by gunmen and ducked a few bullets. Where the old baseball diamond stood, "Mr. Tarnow" and "Phareel" fired back and killed two men before getting gunned down themselves. Children claim they hear rhymes and gunshots when they step on the "baseball diamond", which was turned into a parking lot because of the murder scene.
