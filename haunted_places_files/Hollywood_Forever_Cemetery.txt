description: This cemetery is mainly used to bury old stars of the silver screen. One such star, Valentino, is visited by a "lady in black." She has been reported to take Valentino, the heartthrob actor of the silent 20's era, exactly 2 long-stemmed red roses. She is never disturbed and walks into the mausoleum at night, every night. This is one ghost that can be counted upon to be seen.
