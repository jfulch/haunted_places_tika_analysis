description: It is said that the area was and is still used by the KKK. There is a bridge,it is said people were killed under this bridge. If you put your keys on the bridge for 5 mins,Your car will not start. The road is very bad tho. Its is really hilly and also has no winter maintance. Be alarmed we recentaly walkedup a hill with what looks like a path on it. It is said a the top is the meeting ground. We were walking up the path when i turned the light on the camera on, there in the woods we then seen a white figure. We did not stick around long enough to investigate it. - October 2004 correction: The family that died under the bridge were early setlers in the area from the late 1700's (when the county began to be settled) and some have reported the mother frantically looking for her childen in the underbrush. You can hear the rustling of the bushes and a plaintive call in the distance. Some have reported that she carries a glowing taper or lantern.
