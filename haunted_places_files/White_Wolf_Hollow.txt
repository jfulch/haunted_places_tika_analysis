description: White Wolf Hollow is a popular hangout for local teenagers and coonhunters.  There are reports of seeing floating lights that look like flashlight.  Also people have talked about seeing a huge cat-like critter that has eyes that shine red instead of the normal flourescent green shine.  A lot of the coonhunters have repeatedly ran over "white monkeys" that cross the road in front of their trucks.  When they go back to look for them, there is nothing there.  White Wolf Hollow is next to Kings Mtn State and National Parks.  There are graveyards all in the woods around the parks.
