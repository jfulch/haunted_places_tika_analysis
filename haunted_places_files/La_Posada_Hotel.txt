country: United States
description: This hotel is set aside the Rio Grande River and just aside of St. Augustan Church. The building used to be a convent and many have seen a nun roaming around the hotel as well as a spirit that takes the form of employees and looks just like them but will not talk. Other occurrences such as other sightings, cold spots, someone calling out your name, objects moving and falling with no explanation. You can clearly hear footsteps and running in the St. Augustan Ball Room when there is no one there.
