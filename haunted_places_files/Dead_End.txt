description: Hermit House - At the "Dead End" woods where Stanford and Hamilton meet, there once stood a cabin in the woods inhabited by an old white-bearded hermit. The cabin was along a wooded pathway near a small bridge backing the houses along Montclair. In a fire of unknown origin, sometime in the middle of the last century, the Hermit burned to death and the ruins of the cabin remained for decades afterwards. An entity, believed to be the Hermit, reportedly appears nearby, usually after midnight.
