description: Possible Urban Legend - The ghost tracks are the alleged resting place of a young boy killed by a train on the tracks. It is said that if you roll over the tracks and stop just after you cross them and put your car in neutral, the boy will push the car back over the tracks, up a hill, to save you from his fate. If you put baby powder on your bumper, after he pushes you, you can see his fingerprints. - September Update: the tracks have since been removed.
