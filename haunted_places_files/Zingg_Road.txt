description: This road is between Millstadt and Belleville off State Route 163. There are many stories about this road, such as a bridge where someone hung themselves and if you drive by there on the anniversary of this occurrence you can see them hanging from the bridge. Another one is of a house where when you drive by a ghost truck chases you. Another one that is of a house where supposedly a witch lived, that has since been torn down. -  WARNING: If you go on this road, be very careful, it is full of curves and hills.
