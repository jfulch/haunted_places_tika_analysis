description: In the early 1900's stood a two room asylum for the insane. Students would volunteer there time at the home helping out. It is said, that one early morning the students came out to the home and were beat and raped by the residents in their home.. In the end of this, they set fire to all the cars at the house and then set fire to themselves and the students, killing everyone. To this day the building does not stand, but the foundation of the house and the old smashed, burnt cars are there. It is also said, that if you visit the old land that you will never forget your experience there and gradually lose your well thinking over a period of time. People have said they would be driving down the road by the place and see a fire, but when they get closer to the place the fire would vanish.
