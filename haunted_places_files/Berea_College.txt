Voices can sometimes be heard, and on more than one occasion a photograph of a young African American boy was taken. He appeared to be frightened and about 12 years of age. - March 2007 Correction: Construction on the Boone Tavern Hotel began in 1908, long after the Civil War and Railroad. Berea, Ky. as a city wasn't even established until after the Civil War, and during the war Berea College (which owns Boone Tavern) was only a normal school with two buildings. Also, Boone Tavern has no basement, only a sub-basement that houses an office and laundry. The sub-basement was dug out under the building in the 1940s.
