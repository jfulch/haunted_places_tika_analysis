description: It is one of the oldest covered bridges in the US (built in 1820). There was a murder there where a guy killed a lot of children. When you go at night, you put baby powder all over your car and drive to the center of the bridge and wait 10 minutes with no lights on. During the 10 minutes you can see shadows in the dark, which isn't suppose to happen. When the 10 minutes are up, you leave and go to a lighted place and you are able to see fingerprints on your car from the murdered children
