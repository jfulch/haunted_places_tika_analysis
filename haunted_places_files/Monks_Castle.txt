description: Suppose to be a religious order that if you try to get onto their land, they will chase you. One particular story was about a bunch of kids going in at night and sneaking around (around 1983 - 1985), they said they saw something in the woods that had glowing red eyes that started to chase them. They made it across the gate, as one of the girls sat down on the curb by the street light, a monk grabbed her, and she was never heard from again.
