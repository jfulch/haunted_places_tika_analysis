description: Built in 1811, this abandoned inn is haunted by two ghosts. One is the ghost of a slave named Luther who died while the house was part of the Underground Railroad. After he died of an infected wound, his spirit was seen wandering the ground and dragging his damaged leg. The other ghost is the spirit of a bootlegger named Sam who was killed while in a drunken stupor when his illegal still exploded. Witnesses still hear his drunken laughter in the house.
