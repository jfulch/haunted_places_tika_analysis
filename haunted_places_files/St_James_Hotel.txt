description: Room 18  is haunted by a man that was killed after winning rights to the hotel in a poker game and they say he is so violent, the room is padlocked and no one is allowed in there. A local says staff members occasionally enter the room to refill his Jack Daniels and afterwards, he seems to come downstairs and wreak havoc on the place for about a month - he does NOT want anyone in his room for any reason.
