description: The Langston's store in the Stockyards used to be a hotel and bar/dance hall, the hotel was upstairs and the bar/dance hall was downstairs. Back in the 1800's a girl named Patty was working in the area that is now the Women's boots and Children's department when her boyfriend shot her and killed her. Her sister Rose found out and hung herself upstairs in one of the hotel rooms, which now has the door to it nailed shut. Now the upstairs- which is now the internet office, alterations office and over stock room for Langston's is haunted by Patty- who is looking for her boyfriend and her sister Rose who is looking for Patty. If you stand at the bottom of the stairs, you get a creepy feeling your stomach and the feeling that you don't want to go upstairs. One of the girls who works there with me said once she went up there to get hangers, and the lights started flashing on and off. When she was walking to the stairs to leave, she heard someone behind her and then someone pushed her and she fell down the stairs and scraped up her back really bad.
