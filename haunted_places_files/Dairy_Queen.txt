country: United States
description: Too many things to fit in this description. Receipts of fake orders would print for no reasons. Hear little kids laughing on numerous occasions after being closed. Items were disappearing. Cold spots everywhere. Names of employees yelled during store hours. Stuff would crash off the shelves in the cooler. These events would happen for a period of a month and then nothing. It was like a cycle through out the years of things that are unexplainable.
