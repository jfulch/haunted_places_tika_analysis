description: In the forward 5" Gun Mount, below the decks, a large man in a khaki uniform is seen by sailors out of the corner of their eye or, in some instances, plain as day. The story goes that he was a Gunner's Mate Chief and he went up in the mount to perform maintenance one day without utilizing a safety mechanism and was crushed to death inside the mount when the loader activated. Now he is seen mainly at night inside the mount near the control panels by sailors passing their duty days inside the mount.- February 2005 Update: It has been decommissioned and sunk.
