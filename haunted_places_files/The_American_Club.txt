description: Walking through the back halls of the Hotel a witness came across a Gentleman standing there in a rather dirty Flannel Shirt and torn and faded corduroy pants , Thinking It was odd to see man in such attire at the American Club was really quite strange. They shrugged it off thinking he was a guest enjoying a cigar in the lower level. Bidding him a "Good Evening" , He was just staring there blankly at the wall with his right leg bent against the wall behind him and both hands thrust into his pockets. He just stared so blankly at the floor as though he didn't just see the witness greeting him. Well to get back to the office ,they had to pass him . After they passed him they got a really uneasy feeling... turned around and he was gone. Feeling a little stirred, they called security . And on the playback camera. On the tape it showed the witness wave and talk to someone that wasn't there.
