description: pronounced "Lottie" - on the gravel road you see lights, also see lights coming from inside the grave yard. If you put a can of pop on the grave, try to pick it up and you will not be able to. When you finally can, the can will be empty. Other things are said to happen. - September 2004 additional information: Another story known by the locals was that she fell in love with another man and her jealous husband or lover killed them and threw their bodies from a bluff into the river. If you called on her she was supposed to appear in the trees in white. Supposedly you could hear her crying at night. -  December 2005 Update/Additional Information: Another story is that she lost her mind when her husband died, and kids teased her and called her a witch. The story is in fact a legend in the area, but was based around the Macy/Decatur area. Supposedly there was a trapper married to a Sioux woman, and they had a cabin along the Missouri river around an area called Blackbird Bend. The husband came home from a hunting trip earlier than expected and surprised her and her lover. He killed the man and cut her head off before throwing her body down the mountain and on certain nights you can see a woman in white looking for her wailing head.
