description: Like many theaters, the Riverside Municipal Auditorium decided to put on a production of "The Nutcracker." An old man who had longed to see the show for years, bought admission to the show, but is said to have died of "natural causes" during the play. To this day, people claim to see him there on many occasions. Does he come back to see the end of the show he missed so long ago?
