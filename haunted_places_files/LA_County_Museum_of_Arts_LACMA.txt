description: According to security guards, a woman was shot by her husband because she was sleeping with other men. She is now a very active spirit supposedly begging men who visit the building that see her to (to put it nicely) have sex with her as well as playing with the electrical system. Contractors doing work at the site have left in fear and never come back.
