description: On October 30th 1904 at 11:50 PM, there was a railroad conductor hit and killed while he was attempting to catch a stowaway that jumped out of a freight car into the brush. The conductor fell onto the tracks and was beheaded by the train. And now in late October you can sometimes see the ghost conductor holding a lantern walking down the old abandon tracks looking for stowaways.
