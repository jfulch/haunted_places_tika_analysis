description: The Rose Theatre -  is haunted by the jilted wife of a French trader who murdered him on the grounds before the theatre was built. "Mary" (as we fondly referred to her) is very temperamental and causes mischief whenever a play with a violent theme is produced. There has also been an old man seen sitting in the house when the theatre is empty as well as an unexplainable, un-removable bloodstain on the concrete in the house.
