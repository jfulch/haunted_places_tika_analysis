description: One ghost in particular paces in the shadows late at night. Another prominent ghost on campus is that of a decapitated nurse during WWII. The campus was an insane asylum during this time, and a post-war inmate snapped and cut off a nurse's head. She has been seen walking in the hallways, which now lead to the cafeteria. Ask the students, they can tell you, and the whole college is haunted.
