description: There are a series of tunnels that run under Old Sacramento. These tunnels were originally the streets of Sacramento before the first 8 or so blocks next to the river were raised above sea level to avoid flooding. Apparently, the tunnels had served as opium dens, brothels and possibly for ritualistic activity at some point. Several business owners with access to the tunnels have reported an extremely menacing energy and strange noises coming from the tunnels, and went so far as to hire a paranormal investigator. Rumor is that the tunnels are now sealed off. - August 2005: A visitor to our site reports that the rumor is FALSE - people can still enter the old tunnels through basements of the older buildings in Old Town Sacramento, as long as they have the property owner's permission or are in the company of the property's owner. It is reported everything is still preserved.
