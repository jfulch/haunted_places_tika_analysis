description: On the 5th floor of Lawrence Towers A, it is rumored that a college student (music major) who lived in room 517 hung herself. It is said she was depressed. Rumor has it that the floor was closed down for a few years being "renovated." You can hear a soft voice singing some nights. You may also feel a strong presence when walking through the halls at night - almost as if you want to run back into your room.
