description: If you pass over this bridge at midnight on a foggy winter's night and look in your rearview mirror you will see a pioneer woman who was killed on this bridge. Some say that she is in a covered wagon and some say that she is walking and looking for her son that died. Not all that go will see her, so be patient.
