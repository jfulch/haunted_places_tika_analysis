description: A man had an accident where the dressing rooms are. The weights that make the curtains move, fell down on his head killing him. It is now said by the janitors that you can hear him walking at night and that he even pinches you! If you go up the second floor were the dressing rooms are, stage left, you can still see the cracks on the wall and floor left by the weights!
