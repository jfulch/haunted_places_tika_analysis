description: It's out in the middle of nowhere. Its not really a lake, but one was supposed to be there. The construction workers must have been scared off because of these strange things. On the hill there is a cemetery where something is defiantly wrong. There is a long row of gravestones that all say the people committed suicide. (Twenty years ago) witnesses report they were out there with their girlfriends. They were in an older truck that didn't have any problems. They said that the area around got as bright as the light of day and they suddenly had the feeling that something didn't want them there. The driver wound the starter almost completely off that truck trying to get out of there and after the light went away the truck started right up. - March 2008 Update: This could be a place called Molly's Rock, which is a part of the Sumter National Forest. The cemetery is in a posted area and can not be trespassed on. There is also rumor of a vanishing house.
