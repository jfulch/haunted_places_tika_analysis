description: Library-Music Section - In the Reading Room of the Music Section of the Library there is always a moaning noise that sometimes sounds like voices. Also, the room is always extremely cold or extremely hot. In another part of the Music Library, the Harp room, a mysterious chair, called the "ghost chair" by some appeared out of nowhere and the librarians can't account for where it came from. There is also a room in the back called the Music Recordings Archives where rows and rows of old records lie practically untouched and students often get scared or spooked in this room.
