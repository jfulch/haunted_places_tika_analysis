description: There have been reports of a woman with red heels walking down an empty hall on the 2nd floor. Students get the urge to climb the roof stairs and jump off the roof; a 5th grader did this in the 70s. Lights turn on and off inexplicably, and laughter is heard in the auditorium girls' bathroom.
