description: One Man's Treasure - Former art business. Given by former owner/resident and her two children experiences. Upstairs area - a bedroom door that didn't fit, to where you had to force it shut would open and close itself shut over and over again. Middle room - Very loud knocking, scratching and a rush of leaves heard in the wall (my daughter never stayed in the room after, nor did her cat) A reflection of a women's face and a large bright "orb". Photos can be viewed on www.hauntedsouls.com. Downstairs- On the walls (made of hard plaster) through the hallway a dozen plus paintings fell all at the same time onto the floor. In the restroom a 85% full, give or take, roll of toilet paper unrolled itself completely. Additional unexplained photos of the downstairs area can be viewed also.
