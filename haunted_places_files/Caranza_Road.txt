description: A long Road in the pines said to be the living place of the jersey devil. But this road is more than that it is haunted by many ghosts. The road is named after a Mexican pilot who crashed on the road there is a big memorial there for him. it is said and has been told that 8:30 pm July 12 or the 12 of any month at 8:30 if you have a voice recorder you can hear his plane. it is a strange road if you go down it at night you get the felling that you are being watched from the wood by something but you knaw it is not human. If you ever go `out there bring a flash light there is no light out on the road.
