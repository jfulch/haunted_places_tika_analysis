description: Hauntings of two teenage ghosts that were mysteriously killed in a car crash in a small lake by an old water house. Their ghostly visions are seen at night when there are no car lights and you honk your horn a few times there spirits are seen rising from the lake and then come to knock on your car door. It has also been seen that a pair of bright headlights are shown coming down the narrow road and then disappear.
