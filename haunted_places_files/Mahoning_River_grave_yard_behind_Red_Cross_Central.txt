description: is not but half a mile and on the same street down travel from the tunnel is the now standing central office for the Red Cross of Warren, of which even behind contains it's own graveyard along the edge of the river. The graveyard is dated and worn with only few tombstones behind it with only but thirty at most stones contained. The supposed story follows that a weary and distraught wife of a civil war officer (of himself had been killed in battle) threw herself to the river of what once drew deeper than it's current form. She is seen also annually during winter months thou in flowing white gown or white soaked in blood and haggard and drenched either matter crying can be heard sometimes.
