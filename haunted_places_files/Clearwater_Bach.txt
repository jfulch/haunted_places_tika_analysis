description: In the late 1930's/ Early 1940's Clearwater Beach stationed not only the Coast Guard, but also had a Military Police Training Barracks. There Army MP's would train there for deployment to WWII. Sightings of a young woman in her early 20's running down the beach while wearing an all-white dress. It is said that she was engaged to be married to a G.I. who was shipped overseas. When he died in combat, she disappeared days later. She waits for him to return to her. She will run past you at night. As soon as you approach, she vanishes into thin air. At times she will mumble at very low levels, but the only words that can be made out are "John", and "Wait". Many have seen her, she appears only at night during the summer months.
