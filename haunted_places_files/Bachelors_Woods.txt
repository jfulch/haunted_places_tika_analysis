description: you walk in to the woods in the Bachelors wood's and the tree's seem to hold you back from going in. all of the deer and mice stay away from where the old house's was and the grave yard makes you feel like your being looked at but no one is there. the trees seen to be moving in on you as you go to the grave yard. in the day time if you go there you feel some thing. And at night some times you see stuff. A hole house that is not there anymore. And a women with a baby. as you go in the woods you see deer tracks all over the place but not one by the where the old house's was or in the grave yard. And once there you feel like some one is always there but one is there.
