description: If you cross over the chain blocking the old driveway, you will start to here footsteps all around the boarded up church. If you decide to venture into the grave yard, donâ€™t bother to close the old cast iron gate; an invisible force will shut it for you. Then when you turn to go back down the old driveway, you will notice the chain you just crossed swinging like a jump-rope, even on the stillest of days.
