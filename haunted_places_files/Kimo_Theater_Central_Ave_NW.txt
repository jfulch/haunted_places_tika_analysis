description: A young boy was killed backstage when a hot water pipe burst from the theater's boiler. The tradition is to place a donut backstage before opening night of any performance so things go right, i.e. lighting, sound, etc. There are two other entities that seem to be much older than the young boy. The theater's opening night was in fall of 1927. These entities seem to be from that era, where as the boy is more contemporary.
