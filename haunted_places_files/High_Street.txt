description: On high street there is believed to be a witch cult. There is one larger house and then behind it smaller cottages. The main house is believed to be where the witches practiced human sacrifices.-  February 2004 Correction: a submitter states -The real story for the cult house in Stoneham, MA is this. There aren't mini cottages behind the house, but a building that resembles a small church. Every night there is a candle lit in the upstairs window of the church. They would drive around the block and you could see the light shining through the trees, but it's hard to see if there is anything else back there besides the church.  This is private property, and it is trespassing if you bother this poor woman. The police maybe called. Have respect.
