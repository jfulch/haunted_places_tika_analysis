country: United States
description: The way to get there is to keep going out Oxford road which takes you past Wehr road (but that is another story) and keep driving till you get closer to the campus off to the right is Oxford Milford road. Drive all the way down the road until the end take the curve and pull into the first yard on the right, turn around and pull back onto the main road. Flash your bright lights 3 times, first you should see small flashing red lights, then see the motorcycle headlight coming down the road. The story is there was a guy and a girl whose love was forbidden so they would sneak out to see each other, the girl would take her fathers car and pull out to the end of the road and flash her lights 3 times to signal to her boyfriend to come see her, well one night she signaled him and he began down the road to see her, supposedly a young boy was riding! his bicycle in the road, the guy on the motorcycle didnâ€™t see him until it was too late wrecked into him and they both died, (the red lights are the reflectors off the bicycle) when the girl saw this she hung herself from the barn in her yard (which is the same yard you turn around in) the barn is still there but only remains.
