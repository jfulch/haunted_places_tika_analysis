description: Many hauntings have occurred here, myself seeing a few of them while I worked there. A girl supposedly committed suicide off of the top floor (six stories) back in the twenties or so. However, it is said that she was pushed by her boyfriend during a fight. You can hear the clicks of her heels throughout the day and night. Also, coins are thrown in the lobby from time to time. The worker's elevator opens by itself and takes the employees to floors that they didn't push the buttons to. (Especially the basement-which is very creepy)The hotel is now not in operation. - May 2005 Update: This place was bought by Carrus Publishing April 2005, it is being fixed up and they are not allowing ANY VISITORS!
