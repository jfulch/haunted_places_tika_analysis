description: Spook Light - Just off Hwy. 84, in Wayne County, between Jesup and Screven is a stretch of railroad track that is haunted. The locals call it the "Spook Light". It is said that years ago a rail worker lost his balance and fell on the tracks and a coming train ran over him and cut off his head! He walks the tracks at night, usually at midnight, caring a lantern looking for his head. People who have seen the "Spook Light" can find no explanation for it! - October 2004 update: This is also the Appling County - Spooklight - listed above. it can be seen in both places along the tracks.
