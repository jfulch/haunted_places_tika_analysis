description: This place was an old orphanage. Then it became a place where cancer and pneumonia patients went to die. The road stretches for about 2 miles and there are two entrances. There are 5 buildings on this road, all abandoned. There have been sightings of ghosts and footsteps. Also, there is a manhole right when u reach the fork in the road; if you take it off, on your way back it will be covered again. Or vice-versa. It's guaranteed to happen. Happy haunting!
