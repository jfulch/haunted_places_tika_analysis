description: February 2004 Update: A group of investigators took a bottle of water and Poured the water on the "hill." The water went IN the direction of the car when in neutral. So from their perspective it is nothing more than an optical illusion of a hill- Left off Highway 177, Renschler road splits. Turn left and there will be curves out to a railroad track. Supposedly, if you go out on top of the tracks and sit in the dark, a man and a little boy who were killed out there start to push your car off the tracks. Voices of a man talking can be heard distinctly while the car is being pushed off tracks.- December Update: The tracks have actually been removed. The submitter of the update has heard many different stories, but people all over southern IL seem to know something about it including their friendâ€™s dad in Steeleville. The townspeople talked to them about the legend.
