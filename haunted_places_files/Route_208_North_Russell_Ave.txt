description: Wyckoff Exit - The legend is, there was a girl who was killed by a hit and run, and her father roams the streets (only on Russell Ave) every night from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. looking for her killer. He is also blind. You can ride around all you want before 12:00am and you will not see him, but he seems to appear right at 12:00am. He will stop and stare at every car that drives by, so you will hardly ever see him walking, but yet you drive 1 block and turn around and he has already walked 5 blocks down.
