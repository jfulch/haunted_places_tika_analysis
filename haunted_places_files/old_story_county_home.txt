description: The old Story county home is said to be haunted it closed down 15 yrs ago. They say if you drive by it at night you can see glows like a light was on. It is condemned now with no trespassing signs in front. It was an asylum where people with mental illness lived. They say you can hear moans and cries. So many people died there. It has been said some teenagers went to it one night at midnight and one of them got struck on the head by a piece of falling debris, like someone was jumping on the floor above them to make it fall. - February 2007 Update: the County home was torn down a couple of years ago. The area is still used as the gun range for the local Sheriff's Office. Warning!! ? No Tresspassing
