description: Ghost of a man that killed his entire family with a hatchet is said to patrol the cemetery.  There are supposed to be stone wolves guarding the cemetery at the front gate.  Sometimes they are there sometimes they aren't.  Ghost hunters from this area have been there and they have picked up all kinds of orbs and apparitions in pictures.  Caution: This place is very haunted and is a long way from the road.  DO NOT GO ALONE!  You never know what may happen.
