description: It is believed the basement of this restaurant is haunted by a little girl. there has been only one sighting which was just a glimpse. If you leave the basement door open it causes stacks of soup bowls to fall over for no apparent reason. When you are actually down stairs you feel very uneasy and sometimes you will get "tripped" going up the stairs. It is thought she died of an overdose, the former building used to be a drug store known as Hoch Drug.
