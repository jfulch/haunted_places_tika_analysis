description: the actually college dates back long before Baker was established. It was originally a small Christian college. The original sections of the dormitories date back to the days before Baker. Many of the rooms have 'cold spots' particularly one on the first floor. There are also stories of a girl who long ago hung herself. Witnesses report of shadows at the edge of their vision and hearing unusual sounds coming from what seemed within the walls.
