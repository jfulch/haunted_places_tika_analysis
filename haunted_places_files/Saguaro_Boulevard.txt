description: In the early 1980's there was said to be a young girl who was kidnapped and murdered. Her body parts were hidden throughout a house on Saguaro Blvd. Sometimes you can hear a strange scream, crying, and see a strange figure by the house on Saguaro. Some say she looks scared, as if she was running from something. If you blink to try to take a better look, she disappears.
