description: This building was originally the county poor farm. Many families who lost everything and had no where else to go came here. We are currently turning it into a county history museum. The building is haunted by former residents who liked living there so much that they refused to leave. We've heard a baby crying, footsteps on the second floor when no one is up there; strange odors; and the lights being turned on when the building is closed. This building will be open for tours starting in October. A fee will be charged.
