description: It's a local community theatre to which I belong. Pictures have been taken of outlines of ghosts and it has been known to play tricks on members of The Guild. I have had a few encounters with the ghost. Hearing footsteps, when no one is around, and things moving around. At times, there is also a heavy breathing coming from stage Right.
