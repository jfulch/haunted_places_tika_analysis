description: Fort Totten - 150-year-old military base also an old Indian burial ground (under soccer field). Many areas are haunted. In mid-May '00, one guard was dozing in his patrol car at night when he heard a knock on the window. He opened his eyes to see 2 men, one on either side of the car, pointing at him & laughing. He could see right thru them. This guard (an ex-marine) never believed in ghosts & taunted the others who did. The other guards wouldn't go to that area at night & warned him that it was haunted, but he didn't believe them then.
