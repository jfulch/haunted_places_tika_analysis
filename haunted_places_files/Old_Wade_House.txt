description: This historical site, once a stop for the stagecoaches traveling through, has for years spoken to the tour guides. Whether encouraging guides down the steps of the back bedroom with a feeling of someone pushing, or when heard scuffing around at the butternut house as they make their beds, there is a gentle haunting experience here.
