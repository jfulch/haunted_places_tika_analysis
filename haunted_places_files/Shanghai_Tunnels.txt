description: The shanghai Tunnels were used for kidnapping able men to work on boats. Now are said to be haunted by the men.- June 2005 Update/Additional Information â€“ This is a rather infamous part of Portland as the name suggests. Men would be shanghaied, beaten up to awaken aboard a ship. Also, women would be kidnapped and sold into the sex business. This form of slavery is something that has been both remembered and forgotten (usually at the same time) by Portland natives alike. It is said that the spirit of "NINA" has been known to haunt the halls of the tunnels. The spirit has been seen as that of a woman in white, which matched the description of a girl named Nina who died in those tunnels. In fact, the apparition has been known to stay pretty close to where her name "NINA" has been carved into the brick in one of the passages there. It is an original carving that was put there back in the day.
