description: A very old cemetery, many people have heard a very mournful crying/screaming while driving through the cemetery even in daylight hours. Also, a very horrible feeling of foreboding often comes with hearing these cries and screams. One couple, just using the cemetery as a short cut, heard & felt it, ”The sound and feelings were very alarming in the fact that they seemed to be all around us, as if inside the vehicle with us. It was a very frightening experience due to the fact that it was indeed broad daylight when this occurred.”
