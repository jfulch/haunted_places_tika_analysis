description: The employees have fondly named the "spirit" Bob. Bob loves leaving all kinds of merchandise on the floor, has a fondness for making noises with a variety of things. Must have liked the other kind of "spirits" as a few of us have gotten whiffs of him when there has been no one around. He keeps things interesting!
