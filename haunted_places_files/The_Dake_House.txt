description: The Dake House is known to be haunted by many spirits. It is now an antique shop. It was once home to the local undertaker. Afterwards, it became a family home. The Dake house is very old, and it's most common spirit is of an old woman. Workers report seeing an old woman in a housecoat walking around after everything was locked up. Some people also report being slapped or pushed. I have been there many times.
