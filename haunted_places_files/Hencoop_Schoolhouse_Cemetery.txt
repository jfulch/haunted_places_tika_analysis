description: An old school house now an occupied house is said to have young children haunting it late at night in the downstairs area. It is also said that children are standing by your bed when you awake at night. Just down the road there is a cemetery with unexplained mists and a haunted woodland area behind it. The graveyard dates back to the 1850's and contains many children's graves. Witnesses have seen images in the woods just to the back right of the cemetery. A small clearing shows many signs of paranormal activities at night time.
