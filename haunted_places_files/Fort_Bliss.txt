description: Building #13 - built in 1893 for soldiers of the 18th Infantry. A Calvary soldier was forced to retire because of his age-he may have been a doctor. This depressed man apparently hanged himself in the rafters of building 13. Also in building 13, the swinging doors in the courtroom have a habit of swinging by themselves at times. A cavalry soldier has been seen walking through the halls as well.
