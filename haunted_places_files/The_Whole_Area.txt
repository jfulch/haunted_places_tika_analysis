city: Washington Terrace
country: United States
description: Washington Terrace was originally built in the 1940s a POW camp. It housed Italian prisoners (WWII). Although the Italians were given considerable freedom in Utah during the war, and some even decided to move their families here afterwards many bad emotions, etc., occurred in this area. Some of the original buildings were converted into houses. These houses in the Terrace tend to have odd occurrences, such as unexplained noises and voices and objects moving without apparent cause. - January 2007 Correction: A resident of Washington Terrace reports he and his family have lived there since the end of WWII. There were no POW's there; it was a house area for the workers at the local military base. The buildings here duplexes and in the late 50's where turned into single-family homes. And the other buildings that are still standing are used as city building such as senior citizens and city offices.
