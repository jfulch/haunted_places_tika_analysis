description: A worker claims to have pictures of the ghosts 1 caught ectoplasm on the film ,There is a history to the property since the building has only been there 9 years. The second is from a surveillance camera. When they open some mornings one of the TVâ€™s will be on and the night bartenders and workers swear they made sure everything had been turned off. Workers made it a point to turn it off. Customers feeling cold chills pass through them. Togo boxes falling off the freezer, looked like someone just swipes them off with their arm or something. Dimes in the till on each side you put them back and a while later they are back where they shouldn't be, and lots more. Hasn't been investigated yet, but hope too.
