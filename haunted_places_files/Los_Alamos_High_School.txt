description: The auditorium is the dwelling place of the two most frequently seen ghosts in the school. During a performance one night back in the 50's a girl fell from the spiral staircase above the stage. She died and is said to push people off of the staircase by a huge gust of cold air. Another ghost is of a girl that had a heart attach in the 5th seat from the left in the front row. Whenever somebody sits in this seat they can feel her presence through cold air and a sad, uneasy feeling.
