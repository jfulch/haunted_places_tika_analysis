description: When the building is mostly deserted, occasionally the elevator will start on one floor, move to another floor, the doors will open, & no one is in the elevator. Then in a minute or two, the doors will shut & the elevator starts moving to one of the other floors in the building.Â  Several employees over the years have seen this happen, while others choose not to think about it.
