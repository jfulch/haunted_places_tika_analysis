description: Due to fact this institution is a maximum-security prison which has been standing since the 1800's, there are many stories of hauntings. One is of an deceased inmate in D Block who walks the tiers and landings at night. His footsteps can be heard on the metal stairs and floors as he walks up one side of the stairs and down the other. If you try to catch him, he only speeds up. He has also been seen standing outside of cells causing graveyard officers to rush to the cell, only to find nobody there. The furniture factory and woodshop is also a hangout for the spirit of an inmate who were murdered there. There is an intercom in one of the towers where if you listen closely you can hear the chanting of an inmate who committed suicide. He repeats the same words over and over again in almost a whisper.. the inmate bled to death in his cell.. from that day on the chanting continued through the intercom box which is outside next to the building where it happened.
