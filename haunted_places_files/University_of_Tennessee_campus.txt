description: Strong Hall -  The Women's Residence Hall, Strong, is said to be haunted by the ghost of one of the first female students to attend the school. It is said that she appears in the lobby mirror every year on her birthday. Students have reported strange noises at night, and Sophie, the ghost, is said to take a dislike of sexual indiscretions.December 2003 Addition: "Sophie"... One of the most popular rumors is that the 4th floor Resident Asst's room is considered to be "Sophie's" room and that anyone assigned to that room is teasingly/affectionately nicknamed "Sophie's Roommate". Some have even gone so far as to say that no one RA has lasted more than a year in that room. While Sophie is generally depicted as a benevolent spirit who wants to ensure that the women of Strong uphold their moral decency, many younger students are afraid of her still.
