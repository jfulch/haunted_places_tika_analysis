description: night time is the best always to see paranormal activity so it is known when walking down the headstone paths reading the headstones, when you get to the end and start back an obvious headstone changes from a grave marker to a magnificent headstone. This isn’t seen right in front of the face but when you realize there’s something different that’s what it is. Also whispers had been heard in the wind and trees and only sometimes a woman is looking for her child. Reports of a ghost that guards the entrance to the den. Many claim if you go in the den, you will lose your mind or never be seen again.NO TRESSPASSING - You must have proof you have relatives in this cemetery, violators will be prosecuted.
