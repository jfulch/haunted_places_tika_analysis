description: People have seen a "woman" standing on Stewart's Run Rd., pointing at them, they don't have time to stop the car & end up running through her, at which time she disappears. If you go in the cemetery gates at night, it feels like you are being touched all over by something, like you are packed into a room with a bunch of people. Very creepy feeling.
